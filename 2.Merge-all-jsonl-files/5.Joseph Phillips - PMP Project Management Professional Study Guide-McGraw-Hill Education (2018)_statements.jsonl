Once the code is written, you estimate youll spend $3000 per month updating the software with client information, government regulations, and maintenance. A vendor has proposed to write the code for your company and charge a fee based on the number of clients using the program every month. The vendor will charge you $5 per month per user of the web-based accounting system. You will have roughly 1200 clients using the system each month. However, youll need an in-house accountant to manage the time and billing of the system, so this will cost you an extra $1,200 per month. How many months can you use the system before its better to write your own code rather than hire the vendor? 15 months"}]}
