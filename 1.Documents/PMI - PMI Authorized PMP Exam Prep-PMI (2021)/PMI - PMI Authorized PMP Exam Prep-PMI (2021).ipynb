Accept their invitation but at a later time so that it does not interfere with the audit\\nd. Gracefully decline their invitation\\n10. You have been assigned as the project manager for a large project in the Pacific\\nRim. This is a very important project for both your company and the client. In\\nyour first meeting with the client, you are presented with a very expensive gift for\\nyourself and another expensive gift for your wife.

The owner of the dealership tells you in confidence that he will give you a\\nnew model car to use for free for up to three years if your company purchases his\\nproperty for the new plant. You should:\\na. Say thank you and accept the offer\\nb. Remove yourself from the committee for conflict of interest\\nc. Report the matter to either your superior, the project sponsor, or the corporate\\nlegal group for advice\\nd. Accept the offer as long as the car is in your spouse’s name\\n12. Your company has embarked upon a large project (with you as project manager)\\nand as an output from the project there will be some toxic waste as residue from\\nthe manufacturing operations. A subsidiary plan has been developed for the con-\\ntainment and removal of the toxic waste and no environmental danger exists. This\\ninformation on toxic waste has not been made available to the general public yet,\\nand the general public does not appear to know about this waste problem. During\\nan interview with local newspaper personnel you are discussing the new project\\nand the question of environmental concerns comes up. You should:\\na. Say there are no problems with environmental concerns\\nb. Say that you have not looked at the environmental issues problems as yet\\nc. Say nothing and ask for the next question\\nd. Be truthful and reply as delicately as possible\\n13. As a project manager, you establish a project policy that you, in advance of the\\nmeeting, review all handouts presented to your external customer during project\\nstatus review meetings. While reviewing the handouts, you notice that one slide\\ncontains company confidential information. Presenting this information to the cus-\\ntomer would certainly enhance good will. You should:\\na. Present the information to the customer\\nb. Remove the confidential information immediately\\nc. Discuss the possible violation with senior management and the legal depart-\\nment before taking any action\\nd. Discuss the situation first with the team member that created the slide, and then\\ndiscuss the possible violation with senior management and the legal department\\nbefore taking any action\\n14. You are managing a project for an external client. Your company developed a\\nnew testing procedure to validate certain properties of a product and the new test-\\ning procedure was developed entirely with internal funds. Your company owns\\nall of the intellectual property rights associated with the new test. The work-\\ners that developed the new test used one of the components developed for your\\ncurrent customer as part of the experimental process. The results using the new test\\nshowed that the component would actually exceed the customer’s expectations.\\nYou should:\\na. Show the results to the customer but do not discuss the fact that it came from\\nthe new test procedure\\nb. Do not show the results of the new test procedure since the customer’s specifi-\\ncations call for use of the old test procedures\\nc. Change the customer’s specifications first and then show the customer the results\\nd. Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior\\nmanagement before taking any action\\n15. Using the same scenario as in the previous question, assume that the new test pro-\\ncedure that is expected to be more accurate than the old test procedure indicates\\nthat performance will not meet customer specifications, whereas the old test indi-\\ncates that customer specifications will be barely met. You should:\\na. Present the old test results to the customer showing that specification require-\\nments will be met\\nb. Show both sets of test results and explain that the new procedure is unproven\\ntechnology\\nc. Change the customer’s specifications first and then show the customer the results\\nd. Discuss the release of this information with your legal department and senior\\nmanagement before taking any action\\n16. Your customer has demanded to see the “raw data” test results from last week’s\\ntesting. Usually the test results are not released to customers until after the com-\\npany reaches a conclusion on the meaning of the test results. Your customer has\\nheard from the grapevine that the testing showed poor results. Management has\\nleft the entire decision up to you. You should:\\na. Show the results and explain that it is simply raw data and that your company’s\\ninterpretation of the results will be forthcoming\\nb. Withhold the information until after the results are verified\\nc. Stall for time even if it means lying to the customer\\nd. Explain to the customer your company’s policy of not releasing raw data\\n17. One of your team members plays golf with your external customer’s project man-\\nager. You discover that the employee has been feeding the customer company-\\nsensitive information. You should:\\na. Inform the customer that project information from anyone other than the project\\nmanager is not official until released by the project manager\\nb. Change the contractual terms and conditions and release the information\\nc. Remove the employee from your project team\\nd. Explain to the employee the ramifications of his actions and that he still repre-\\nsents the company when not at work, then report this as a violation\\n18. Your company has a policy that all company-sensitive material must be stored in\\nlocked filing cabinets at the end of each day. One of your employees has received\\nseveral notices from the security office for violating this policy. You should:\\na. Reprimand the employee\\nb. Remove the employee from your project\\nc. Ask the human resources group to have the employee terminated\\nd. Counsel the employee as well as other team members on the importance of con-\\nfidentiality and the possible consequences for violations\\n19. You have just received last month’s earned value information that must be shown\\nto the customer in the monthly status review meeting. Last month’s data showed\\nunfavorable variances that exceeded the permissible threshold limits on time and\\ncost variances. This was the result of a prolonged power outage in the manufactur-\\ning area. Your manufacturing engineer tells you that this is not a problem and next\\nmonth you will be right on target on time and cost as you have been in the last five\\nmonths. You should:\\na. Provide the data to the customer and be truthful in the explanation of the\\nvariances\\nb. Adjust the variances so that they fall within the threshold limits since this prob-\\nlem will correct itself next month\\nc. Do not report any variances this month\\nd. Expand the threshold limits on the acceptable variances but do not tell the\\ncustomer\\n20. You are working in a foreign country where it is customary for a customer to pres-\\nent gifts to the contractor’s project manager throughout the project as a way of\\nshowing appreciation. Declining the gifts would be perceived by the customer as\\nan insult. Your company has a policy on how to report gifts received. The best way\\nto handle this situation would be to:\\na. Refuse all gifts\\nb. Send the customer a copy of our company’s policy on accepting gifts\\nc. Accept the gifts and report the gifts according to policy\\nd. Report all gifts even though the policy says that some gifts need not be reported\\n21. You are interviewing a candidate to fill a project management position in your\\ncompany. On his resume, he states that he is a PMP®. One of your workers who\\nknows the candidate informs you that he is not a PMP® yet but is planning to take\\nthe test next month and certainly expects to pass. You should:\\na. Wait until he passes the exam before interviewing him\\nb. Interview him and ask him why he lied\\nc. Inform PMI of the violation\\nd. Forget about it and hire him if he looks like the right person for the job\\n22. You are managing a multinational project from your office in Chicago. Half of\\nyour project team are from a foreign country but are living in Chicago while work-\\ning on your project. These people inform you that two days during next week are\\nnational religious holidays in their country and they will be observing the holiday\\nby not coming into work. You should:\\na. Respect their beliefs and say nothing\\nb. Force them to work because they are in the United States where their holiday is\\nnot celebrated\\nc. Tell them that they must work noncompensated overtime when they return to\\nwork in order to make up the lost time\\nd. Remove them from the project team if possible\\n23. PMI informs you that one of your team members who took the PMP® exam last\\nweek and passed may have had the answers to the questions in advance provided\\nto him by some of your other team members who are also PMP®s and were tutor-\\ning him. PMI is asking for your support in the investigation. You should:\\na. Assist PMI in the investigation of the violation\\nb. Call in the employee for interrogation and counseling\\nc. Call in the other team members for interrogation and counseling\\nd. Tell PMI that it is their problem, not your problem\\n24. One of your team members has been with you for the past year since his grad-\\nuation from college. The team member informs you that he is now a PMP® and\\nshows you his certificate from PMI acknowledging this. You wonder how he was\\nqualified to take the exam since he had no prior work experience prior to joining\\nyour company one year ago. You should:\\na. Report this to PMI as a possible violation\\nb. Call in the employee for counseling\\nc. Ask the employee to surrender his PMP® credentials\\nd. Do nothing\\n25. Four companies have responded to your RFP. Each proposal has a different techni-\\ncal solution to your problem and each proposal states that the information in the\\nproposal is company-proprietary knowledge and not to be shared with anyone.\\nAfter evaluation of the proposals, you discover that the best technical approach is\\nfrom the highest bidder. You are unhappy about this. You decide to show the pro-\\nposal from the highest bidder to the lowest bidder to see if the lowest bidder can\\nprovide the same technical solution but at a lower cost. This situation is:\\na. Acceptable since once the proposals are submitted to your company, you have\\nunlimited access to the intellectual property in the proposals\\nb. Acceptable since all companies do this\\nc. Acceptable as long as you inform the high bidder that you are showing their\\nproposal to the lowest bidder\\nd. Unacceptable and is a violation of the Code of Professional Conduct'"
