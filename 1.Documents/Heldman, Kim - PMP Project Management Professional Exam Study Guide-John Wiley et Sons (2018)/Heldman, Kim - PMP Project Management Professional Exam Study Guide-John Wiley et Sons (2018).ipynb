    "answer_text='1. C. The Project Management Institute (PMI®) is the industry-recognized standard for\\nproject management practices.\\n2. B. Projects exist to create a unique product, service, or result. The logon screen in this\\nquestion is not a unique product. A minor change has been requested, indicating that this is\\nan ongoing operations function. Some of the criteria for projects are that they are unique,\\ntemporary with definitive start and end dates, and considered complete when the project\\ngoals are achieved.\\n3. A. This is a project. The product line is new, which implies that this is a unique product—it\\nhasn’t been done before. You can discern a definite start and end date by the fact that the\\nnew appliances must be ready by the spring catalog release.\\n4. D. Progressive elaboration is the process of determining the characteristics and features\\nof the product of the project. Progressive elaboration is carried out via steps in detailed\\nfashion.\\n5. D. A project is considered successful when it achieves its objectives and stakeholder needs\\nand expectations are met.\\n6. B. Conflicts between stakeholders should always be resolved in favor of the customer. This\\nquestion emphasizes the importance of identifying your stakeholders and their needs as\\nearly as possible in the project.\\n7. C. Project management brings together a set of tools and techniques to organize project\\nactivities. Project managers are the ones responsible for managing the project management\\nprocesses.\\n8. B. There are three ways phases can be performed in a multiphased project: sequential,\\niterative, and overlapping. Iterative is when more than one phase is being performed at the\\nsame time and overlapping occurs when one phase starts before the prior phase completes.\\nAll phases should perform a phase gate review.\\n9. D. Portfolios are collections of projects and/or programs. The projects or programs do not\\nhave to be directly related or interdependent to reside within the portfolio.\\n10. A. Team members choose items from the backlog list to work on during the upcoming\\nsprint at the sprint planning meeting.\\n11. A. The storyboard is a deliverable. Because the phases are performed sequentially, the\\ndeliverable must be approved before the next phase of the project can begin.\\n12. C. The best answer to this question according to the PMBOK ® Guide is to negotiate with\\nthe functional manager to participate in the business analyst’s annual performance review.\\nOption D is an appropriate response but doesn’t include the direction that the project\\nmanager should participate in the performance review.\\nChapter 2: Creating the Project Charter 615\\n13. B. The level of authority the project manager has is determined by the organizational\\nstructure, interactions with various management levels, and the project management\\nmaturity level of the organization.\\n14. A. Advantages for employees in a functional organization are that they have only one\\nsupervisor and a clear chain of command exists.\\n15. D. Employees in a balanced matrix often report to two or more managers. Functional\\nmanagers and project managers share authority and responsibility for projects. There is a\\nbalance of power between the functional managers and project managers.\\n16. C. This question describes the Agile methodology, which uses daily standups, sprint\\nplanning meetings, and retrospectives, and works with a Scrum master and product owner.\\n17. D. Remember the acronym that sounds like syrup of ipecac: IPECC (Initiating, Planning,\\nExecuting, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing).\\n18. B. An iterative phase relationship allows you to work more than one phase at a time.\\n19. C. The Initiating process group is where stakeholders have the greatest ability to influence\\noutcomes of the project. Risk is highest during this stage because of the high degree of\\nunknown factors.\\n20. A. The three types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive.\\n1. A. OPAs are internal to the organization. EEFs can be internal or external to the\\norganization but they are always outside the control of the project team.\\n2. B. This came about because of an organizational need. Staff members were spending\\nunproductive hours producing information for the management report that wasn’t\\nconsistent or meaningful.\\n3. A. Develop Project Charter has four inputs, and they are business documents, agreements,\\nenterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.\\n4. C. The most correct answer is to perform a feasibility study. Because this project is taking\\nthe company into a new, unknown market, there’s lots of potential for error and failure. A\\nfeasibility study would help the stakeholders determine whether the project is viable and\\ncost effective and whether it has a high potential for success.\\n5. D. Project Schedule Management involves the following processes: Plan Schedule\\nManagement, Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Durations, Develop\\nSchedule, and Control Schedule.'"

    "answer_text='1. A. OPAs are internal to the organization. EEFs can be internal or external to the\\norganization but they are always outside the control of the project team.\\n2. B. This came about because of an organizational need. Staff members were spending\\nunproductive hours producing information for the management report that wasn’t\\nconsistent or meaningful.\\n3. A. Develop Project Charter has four inputs, and they are business documents, agreements,\\nenterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets.\\n4. C. The most correct answer is to perform a feasibility study. Because this project is taking\\nthe company into a new, unknown market, there’s lots of potential for error and failure. A\\nfeasibility study would help the stakeholders determine whether the project is viable and\\ncost effective and whether it has a high potential for success.\\n5. D. Project Schedule Management involves the following processes: Plan Schedule\\nManagement, Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Durations, Develop\\nSchedule, and Control Schedule.\\n616 \\n6. B. The benefits management plan outlines the benefits of the project (both tangible and\\nintangible), describes a timeline in which the benefits will be realized, and describes the\\nstrategic alignment of the benefits. Commercial databases are an example of an internal\\nEEF.\\n7. B. Historical information on projects of a similar nature can be helpful when initiating new\\nprojects. They can help in formulating project deliverables and identifying constraints and\\nassumptions and will be helpful later in the project Planning processes as well.\\n8. C. The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area consists of the following\\nprocesses: Develop Project Charter, Develop Project Management Plan, Direct and Manage\\nProject Work, Manage Project Knowledge, Monitor and Control Project Work, Perform\\nIntegrated Change Control, and Close Project or Phase.\\n9. A. Option B describes the project exit criteria. Option C is not true, and Option D is\\npartially true. The project manager does not dictate what the approval requirements are.\\nThe stakeholders and sponsor will come to an agreement on the success criteria, and the\\nproject manager may or may not have a voice in the decision.\\n10. B. Projects with NPV greater than 0 should be given an accept recommendation.\\n11. B. Projects with the highest IRR value are favored over projects with lower IRR values.\\n12. A. Net present value (NPV) assumes reinvestment is made at the cost of capital.\\n13. C. Year 1 and 2 inflows are each $100,000 for a total of $200,000, year 3 inflows are an\\nadditional $300,000 . Add one more quarter to this total, and the $575,000 is reached in\\nthree years and three months, or 39 months.\\n14. D. IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate and is the discount rate when NPV is\\nequal to 0\\n15. C. The purpose of the business case is to understand the business need for the project and\\ndetermine whether the investment in the project is worthwhile.

    "answer_text='1. A. The policies, rules, systems, relationships, and norms are part of the organizational\\ngovernance framework, which is part of the EEF input for the Develop Project Management\\nPlan process. Management elements include authority levels of works, disciplinary actions,\\nchain of command, fair treatment, fair payment, communication channels, and safety of\\nstaff members.\\n2. C. The project management plan describes the processes you’ll use to perform the project\\nand describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled and how the\\nwork of the project will be executed to meet the objectives.\\n3. B. The scope management plan describes how project scope will be defined and validated,\\nhow the scope statement will be developed, how the WBS will be created and defined,\\nand how project scope will be managed and controlled. Project scope is measured against\\nthe project management plan, whereas product scope is measured against the product\\nrequirements. It is based on the approved project scope.\\n4. D. These four decision-making techniques belong to the Collect Requirements process and\\nare part of the decision-making tool and technique in this process.\\n5. B. The project scope statement further elaborates the project deliverables and documents\\nthe product scope description, acceptance criteria, and project exclusions. It serves as a\\nbasis for future project decisions.\\n6. D. The requirements traceability matrix links requirements to their origin and traces them\\nthroughout the project. Option A describes the requirements management plan, not the\\nrequirements document. Option B is partially true with the exception of the first statement.\\nRequirements documents do not have to be formal or complex. Option C refers to the\\nproject scope statement, not the requirements.\\n7. C. The scope baseline consists of the approved project scope statement, the WBS, work\\npackages, planning packages, and the WBS dictionary.\\n8. D. Alternatives analysis is a part of the data analysis tool and technique of the Define\\nScope process that includes brainstorming and lateral thinking techniques.\\n9. C. You could use each product as a level one entry on the WBS so Option A is correct,\\nbut you may choose to construct the WBS differently. Option C is not correct because\\nrolling wave planning is the process of fully elaborating near-term WBS work packages\\nand expanding others, like the third product in this question, at a later time when all\\ninformation is known.\\n10. D. Option A might seem like a correct answer, but Option D is more correct. There isn’t\\nenough information to determine whether stakeholders will require overtime. We do know\\nthat poor scope definition might lead to cost increases, rework, schedule delays, and poor\\nmorale.\\n618 \\n11. D. Each element in the WBS is assigned a unique identifier called a code of accounts\\nidentifier. Typically, these codes are associated with a corporate chart of accounts and are\\nused to track the costs of the individual work elements in the WBS.\\n12. A. The work package level is the lowest level in the WBS and facilitates resource\\nassignment and cost and time estimates. In this question, the work package level contains\\nfour subprojects, so it would not be used to create the activity list. The activity list will be\\ncreated from the work package level for each WBS created for each subproject.\\n13. C. The primary constraint is time. Since the trade show demos depend on project\\ncompletion and the trade show is in late September, the date cannot be moved. The budget\\nis the secondary constraint in this example.\\n14. A. Decomposition subdivides the major deliverables into smaller components. It is a\\ntool and technique of the Create WBS process and is used to create a WBS. Level two\\ncomponents might be deliverables, phases, subprojects, or some combination.\\n15. B. Product analysis includes techniques such as value engineering, value analysis, systems\\nanalysis, systems engineering, product breakdown, and functional analysis.\\n16. D. The primary constraint is quality. If you made the assumption as stated in Options A,\\nB, and C, you assumed incorrectly. Clarify these assumptions with your stakeholders and\\nproject sponsors.\\n17. C. This is an example of an assumption. You’ve used this vendor before and haven’t had\\nany problems. You’re assuming there will be no problems with this delivery based on your\\npast experience.\\n18. B. Constraints restrict the actions of the project team.\\n19. A. The project came about because of a business need. The phones have to be answered\\nbecause that’s the core business. Upgrading the system to handle more volume is a business\\nneed. An assumption has been made regarding vendor availability. Always validate your\\nassumptions.\\n20. B. The steps of decomposition include identify major deliverables, organize and determine\\nthe structure, identify lower-level components, assign identification codes, and verify\\ncorrectness of decomposition.'"

    "answer_text='1. C. The tools and techniques for Estimate Activity Durations are expert judgment,\\nanalogous estimating, parametric estimating, three-point estimating, bottom-up estimating,\\ndata analysis (alternatives analysis, reserve analysis), decision making, and meetings.\\n2. B. The Sequence Activities process produces project schedule network diagrams and project\\ndocuments updates, which include updating the activity list, activity attributes, assumption\\nlog, and milestone list. The purpose of this process is to identify all activity dependencies.\\nChapter 4: Creating the Project Schedule 619\\n3. C. Reserve analysis takes schedule risk into consideration and adds a percentage of time or\\nadditional work periods to the estimate to prevent schedule delays.\\n4. A. Parametric estimating uses an algorithm or formula that multiplies a known element—\\nsuch as the quantity of materials needed—by the time it takes to install or complete one\\nunit of materials. The result is a total estimate for the activity. In this case, 10 servers\\nmultiplied by 16 hours per server gives you a 160-hour total duration estimate.\\n5. C. The activity list is a component of the project schedule, not the WBS. The activity list\\nincludes all the project activities, an identifier, and a description of the activity. The activity\\nlist is an output of the Define Activities process.\\n6. D. This is an example of a mandatory dependency, also known as hard logic. Mandatory\\ndependencies are inherent in the nature of the work. Discretionary dependencies, also called\\npreferred logic, preferential logic, and soft logic, are defined by the project management\\nteam.\\n7. A. The precedence diagramming method is also known as the activity on node (AON)\\ndiagramming method. GERT stands for Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique, a\\ndiagramming method that allows for conditions, branches, and loops.\\n8. B. The arrow diagramming method uses only finish-to-start dependencies.\\n9. D. Finish-to-start (FS) is the most commonly used logical relationship in PDM and the\\ndefault relationship in most project management software packages.\\n10. C. CPM calculates a single early and late start date and a single early and late finish date\\nfor each activity. Once these dates are known, float time is calculated for each activity to\\ndetermine the critical path. The other answers contain elements of PERT calculations.\\n11. B. The only information you have for this example is activity duration; therefore, the\\ncritical path is the path with the longest duration. Path A-D-E-H with a duration of 34 days\\nis the critical path.\\n12. D. The only information you have for this example is activity duration, so you must\\ncalculate the critical path based on the durations given. The duration of A-B-C-E-H\\nincreased by 3 days, for a total of 35 days. The duration of A-F-G-H and A-F-G-E-H each\\nincreased by 3 days. A-F-G-E-H totals 36 days and becomes the new critical path.\\n13. D. You calculate the critical path by adding together the durations of all the tasks with zero\\nor negative float. The critical path can be compressed using crashing techniques.\\n14. C. The calculation for PERT is the sum of optimistic time plus pessimistic time plus four\\ntimes the most likely time divided by 6, the calculation for this example is as follows:\\n[48 + 72 + (4 × 60)] / 6 = 60 \\n15. D. You calculate the standard deviation by subtracting the optimistic time from the\\npessimistic time and dividing the result by 6, the calculation for this example is as follows:\\n(72 – 48) / 6 = 4\\n16. D. There is a 95 percent probability that the work will finish within plus or minus two\\nstandard deviations. The expected value is 500, and the standard deviation times 2 is 24, so\\nthe activity will take from 476 to 524 days. \\n17. B. A 68 percent probability is calculated using plus or minus one standard deviation,\\na 95 percent probability uses plus or minus two standard deviations, and a 99 percent\\nprobability uses plus or minus three standard deviations.\\n18. A. Crashing the schedule includes tasks such as adding resources to the critical path tasks\\nor speeding up deliveries of materials and resources.\\n19. C. Resource leveling is used for overallocated resources and allows for changes to the\\nschedule completion dates. Crashing and fast tracking are schedule compression techniques\\nthat shorten the schedule. Resource smoothing techniques will not allow for changes to\\nthe critical path or project end date, and since you are concerned about not overusing this\\nresource, lengthening the schedule is a better option.\\n20. A. Project management software is a useful tool for the project manager, and it automates\\nproject scheduling, allowing for what-if analysis and easy changes. But if you focus too\\nmuch on the tool and ignore the project, the tool becomes a hindrance.'"

    "answer_text='1. A. The communications management plan defines and manages the flow of project\\ninformation, not the stakeholder engagement plan. The stakeholder engagement plan does\\ncontain information about the distribution, reasons, and timing of information.\\n2. D. The cost management plan, an output of the Plan Cost Management process, is used to\\nestablish the criteria for planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs. It is based\\non the approved project charter, project schedule, the risk management plan, and other\\ninformation in order to manage project costs.\\n3. D. Control thresholds are variance thresholds (typically stated as a percentage of deviation\\nfrom the baseline) used for monitoring cost performance.\\n4. C. A control account can be placed at any level of the WBS and is used for earned value\\nmeasurement calculations regarding project costs.\\n5. A. Scope definition is the key component of determining cost estimates. It should be\\ncompleted early in the project because costs are more easily influenced at the beginning of\\nthe project.\\n6. B. Three-point estimating can improve activity cost estimates because they factor in\\nestimation uncertainty and risk.\\n7. A. Reserve analysis accounts for cost uncertainty by including a contingency reserve,\\nusually expressed as a percentage of the estimated cost.\\nChapter 5: Developing the Project Budget and Communicating the Plan 621\\n8. C. The expected activity cost using the three-point beta distribution formula (also known\\nas PERT) is calculated this way: [(4 × most likely) + optimistic + pessimistic] / 6, therefore,\\nthe answer is [(4 × 42) + 35 + 54] / 6 = 43\\n9. C. Future period operating costs are considered ongoing costs and are not part of project\\ncosts.\\n10. B. Bottom-up techniques are the most time-consuming and generally the most accurate\\nestimates you can use. With bottom-up estimating, each work item is estimated and rolled\\nup to a project total.\\n11. A. Funding limit reconciliation concerns reconciling the funds to be spent on the project\\nwith funding limits placed on the funding commitments for the project.\\n12. B. The cost baseline is displayed as an S-curve because of the way project spending occurs.\\nSpending begins slowly, picks up speed until the spending peak is reached, and then tapers\\noff as the project winds down.\\n13. D. Cost of quality is part of the data analysis tool and technique of Estimate Costs. The\\ntools and techniques of Determine Budget are cost aggregation, data analysis (reserve\\nanalysis), expert judgment, historical information review, funding limit reconciliation, and\\nfinancing.\\n14. A. Analogous—or top-down—estimating techniques are a form of expert judgment.\\nBecause this project is similar to another recent project, you can use the cost estimates\\nfrom the previous project to help you quickly determine estimates for the current\\nproject.\\n15. D. There are 36 channels of communication, yourself plus 8 stakeholders. The formula\\nis 9(9–1)/2 = 36, Lines of communication are considered when using the communications\\nrequirements analysis tool and technique.\\n16. D. Expert judgement, communications requirements analysis, communication\\ntechnology, communication models, communication methods, interpersonal and team\\nskills (communication styles assessment, political awareness, cultural awareness), data\\nrepresentation (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix), and meetings are the tools and\\ntechniques of the Plan Communications Management process.\\n17. C. Acknowledgment means the receiver has received the message but does not mean they\\nagree with the message.\\n18. A. Push communication ensures that information is distributed to specific recipients but\\ndoes not certify that it was understood by the intended recipients.\\n19. B. This describes interactive communication. It is a communication method, which is a tool\\nand technique of Plan Communications Management.\\n20. C. Reasons for the distribution of information belong in the communications management\\nplan.'"

    "answer_text='1. B. Ambiguity risk is addressed using gap analysis or benchmarking. Document what you\\nknow, and identify what is uncertain or not understood and work with experts outside of\\nthe organization to fill in the gaps in knowledge.\\n2. C. The purpose of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is to determine what impact the\\nidentified risk events will have on the project and the probability they’ll occur. It also puts\\nrisks in priority order according to their effects on the project objectives and assigns a risk\\nscore for the project.\\n3. B. The risk management plan details how risk management processes will be implemented,\\nmonitored, and controlled throughout the life of the project. The risk management plan\\ndoes not include responses to risks or triggers. Responses to risks are documented in the\\nrisk register as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.\\n4. C. Continuous probability distributions graphically display the probability of risk to the\\nproject objectives as well as the time or cost elements.\\n5. D. The data representation tool and technique called a bubble chart is a way to graphically\\ndisplay three factors of risk characteristics.\\n6. C. Criticality analysis determines the risk impact to critical path tasks on the project\\nschedule.\\n7. C. Forecasted results of the project schedule and costs as determined by the outcomes of\\nrisk analysis is an update that is produced from the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis\\nprocess.\\n8. B. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs, so it’s an opportunity,\\nand the appropriate strategy to use in this case is the exploit strategy.\\n9. D. This risk event has the potential to save money on project costs. Sharing involves using a\\nthird party to help ensure that the opportunity occurs.\\n10. A. The best answer is A.

This is a cost-reimbursable contract that includes a fee as a percentage of allowable\\ncosts. This type of contract is known as a cost plus percentage of cost (CPPC) contract.\\n12. A. Design of experiments is not a named tool and technique of any process but is\\ncommonly used in the Plan Quality Management process to provide statistical analysis for\\nchanging key product or process elements all at once (not one at a time) to optimize the\\nprocess.\\n13. C. Philip Crosby devised the zero defects theory, meaning do it right the first time. Proper\\nPlan Quality Management leads to less rework and higher productivity. Joseph Juran’s\\nfitness for use says that stakeholders’ and customers’ expectations are met or exceeded.\\n14. A. W. Edwards Deming conjectured that the cost of quality is a management problem 85\\npercent of the time and that once the problem trickles down to the workers, it is outside\\ntheir control.\\n15. C. The benefits of meeting quality requirements are increased stakeholder satisfaction,\\nlower costs, higher productivity, and less rework.\\n16. A. Internal failure costs are costs associated with not meeting the customer’s expectations\\nwhile you still had control over the product. This results in rework, scrapping, and\\ndowntime.\\n17. B. Quality metrics are an output of the Plan Quality Management process and not part of\\nthe quality management plan.\\n18. D. This is an example of design of experiments.\\n19. B. Six Sigma is a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and\\nvariation reduction by applying Six Sigma methodologies to the project.\\n20. C.

    "answer_text='1. D. The Monitor and Control Project Work process involves reporting actual project results\\nand how they compare to the project management plan, analyzing performance data,\\nmonitoring change requests, and more.\\n2. C. You are in the Monitor and Control Project Work process and should recommend a\\nchange request that can take the form of a corrective action. Preventive actions reduce the\\npossibility of negative impacts from risk events and do not apply to this situation.\\n3. D. Negotiation, using ADR, is the preferred method of settling claims or disputes in the\\nControl Procurements process.\\n4. D. Inspections and audits are both tools and techniques of the Control Procurements\\nprocess.\\n5. C. The contract change control system describes the processes you’ll use to make changes\\nto the contract; it is not a means of communication. The changes might include contract\\nterm changes, date changes, and termination of a contract.\\n6. B. According to the PMBOK ® Guide, the Control Procurements process is closely\\ncoordinated with the Direct and Manage Project Work, Control Quality, Perform\\nIntegrated Change Control, and Monitor Risks processes.\\n7. A. Status review meetings are a type of work performance report, which is an output of\\nMonitor and Control Project Work.\\n8. A. This question describes the Monitor Communications process, which is concerned\\nwith collecting and reporting information regarding project progress and project\\naccomplishments to the stakeholders.\\n9. A. The tools and techniques of the Monitor Communications process are: expert\\njudgement, PMIS, data representation (stakeholder engagement assessment matrix),\\ninterpersonal and team skills (observation/conversation), and meetings. Data analysis listed\\nin Option A is from the Control Procurements process.\\n10. B. The Delphi method, technology forecasting, scenario building, and forecast by analogy\\nare all in the judgmental methods category of forecasting.\\n11. B. This question describes the project documents–issue log input of the Monitor\\nCommunications process. It is used to track issues, assign owners, track due dates, and\\nmore. Options A and C are tools and techniques of this process, and Option D is an input.\\n12. B. When you are dealing with contested changes, ADR (alternative dispute resolution)\\nis the technique you should use first to try to reach resolution. The other options are\\nalternatives after you’ve tried ADR.\\n13. B. Change requests are submitted through other processes like the Monitor and Control\\nProject Work process, and they are reviewed, tracked, managed, analyzed, and documented\\nin this process.\\n14. D. Change control systems are documented procedures that describe how to submit change\\nrequests. They track the status of the change requests, document the management impacts\\nof change, track the change approval status, and define the level of authority needed to\\napprove changes. Change control systems do not approve or deny the changes—that’s the\\nresponsibility of the change control board (CCB).\\n15. C. The key to this question was that the characteristics of the product were documented\\nwith this tool. Configuration management documents the physical characteristics and the\\nfunctionality of the product of the project.\\n16. C. Change control boards (CCBs) review change requests and have the authority to\\napprove or deny them. Their authority is defined by the configuration control and change\\ncontrol process.\\n17. A. The three activities associated with configuration management are configuration\\nidentification, configuration status accounting, and configuration verification and auditing.\\n18. D. Configuration management systems are a way to manage approved changes and\\nbaselines.\\n19. C. These are elements with which the Monitor and Control Project Work process is\\nconcerned.\\n20. C. The other names for CCB’s may include TAB, which stands for technical assessment\\nboard; TRB, which is a technical review board; and ERB, which is an engineering review\\nboard.'"

    "answer_text='1. A. Changes to product scope should be reflected in the project scope.\\n2. D. Scatter diagrams display the relationship between an independent and dependent\\nvariable over time.\\n3. C. WBS element changes are scope changes. According to the PMBOK ® Guide, schedule\\nrevisions are often required as a result of scope changes.\\n4. C. The Validate Scope process is concerned with the acceptance of work results. It also\\nformalizes the acceptance of the project scope.\\n5. B. Validate Scope should document the level and degree of completion of the project given\\nthe circumstances in this question. If you come back at a later date and restart this project,\\nValidate Scope will describe how far the project progressed and give you an idea of where\\nto start.\\n630 \\n6. B. Schedule variances will sometimes—but not always—impact the schedule. Changes to\\nnoncritical path tasks will not likely impact the schedule, but changes to critical path tasks\\nwill always impact the schedule.\\n7. C. The To-complete performance index determines the cost performance that must be\\nrealized for the remaining work of the project to meet a goal such as BAC or EAC.\\n8. D. Budget updates might require cost re-baselining.\\n9. A. Schedule variance is (EV – PV) and the schedule performance index is (EV / PV).\\n10. C. Earned value is referred to as the value of the work that’s been completed to date\\ncompared to the budget.\\n11. D. The CV is a positive number and is calculated by subtracting AC from EV as follows:\\n250 – 200 = 50, A positive CV means the project is coming in under budget, meaning\\nyou’ve spent less than you planned as of the measurement date.\\n12. A. The SV calculation is EV – PV. If PV is a higher number than EV, you’ll get a negative\\nnumber as a result.\\n13. B. CPI is calculated as follows: EV / AC. In this case, 250 / 200 = 1,25 \\n14. B. When you accept project performance to date and assume future ETC work will be\\nperformed at the budgeted rate, EAC is calculated as follows: AC + (BAC – EV). Therefore,\\nthe calculation for this question looks like this: 200 + (800 – 250) = 750 \\n15. C. The correct formula for ETC for this question is as follows: EAC – AC. Therefore, ETC\\nis as follows: 375 – 200 = 175 \\n16. A. When project performance is expected to behave like past performance, EAC is\\ncalculated as follows: EAC = BAC / CPI. Therefore, the calculation for this question looks\\nlike this: 800 / 1,25 = 640\\n17. D. You first have to calculate EAC in order to calculate VAC. EAC for variances that\\nare atypical is AC + (BAC – EV). So, our numbers are 275 + (500 – 250) = 525, VAC is\\ncalculated this way: BAC – EAC. Therefore, 500 – 525 = –25, Our costs are not doing as\\nwell as anticipated.\\n18. C. You must first calculate CPI in order to calculate ETC. CPI is EV / AC. We have 1150 /\\n1275 = 0,90 ETC with typical cost variances is (BAC –EV) / CPI. Our numbers are (2500 –\\n1150) / 0,90 = 1500\\n19. B. Workarounds are unplanned responses. They deal with negative risk events as they\\noccur. As the name implies, workarounds were not previously known to the project team.\\nThe risk event was unplanned, so no contingency plan existed to deal with the risk event,\\nand thus it required a workaround.\\n20. C. Control Resources ensures physical resources are available at the time they are needed\\nand at the location they are needed. It also ensures the resources are released when their\\njob is completed and that corrective actions are taken when resources are not utilized as\\nplanned.'"

Starvation occurs because the project no longer receives the resources needed to\\ncontinue. Resources include people, equipment, money, and the like.\\n3. A. Extinction is the best type of project end because it means the project was completed\\nsuccessfully and accepted by the sponsor or customer.\\n4. C. Written notice of contract closure is part of the Control Procurements process. This\\nprocess involves the project manager documenting the formal acceptance of the work of the\\ncontract.\\n5. A. Document analysis is performed to identify lessons learned and capture and share\\nknowledge for use on future projects.\\n6. B. Lessons learned document the experiences, successes, and failures that occurred\\nduring this project for future reference. There isn’t enough information in the question to\\ndetermine whether Option A or D is correct. Option C is not correct because the project\\nwas completed.\\n7. C. Regression analysis examines project variables and how they contributed to project\\noutcomes for the purpose of improving performance on future projects.\\n8. B. You are not responsible for the personal integrity of others, but as project manager you\\ndo have influence over others, such as your project team members.\\n9. C. Integrity means you’ll honestly report project outcomes and status. Your personal gain\\nshould not be placed above the satisfaction of the customer.\\n10. D. The best answer to this problem is to develop alternative solutions to address the\\ndesign error. Reducing technical requirements might be an alternative solution, but it’s not\\none you’d implement without looking at all the alternatives. Ignoring the error and going\\nforward with production will result in an unsatisfactory product for the customer.\\n11. A. A luncheon date could be considered a conflict of interest prior to awarding a contract\\nto a vendor. Consider what a competitor of this vendor would think if they spotted you\\nhaving lunch together.\\n12. B. The best response to this situation is to thank the vendor and decline based on the fact\\nthat this could be considered personal gain on your part. Option D might seem correct,\\nbut remember, you’re not responsible for the integrity of others. It’s often common business\\npractice for vendors to offer gifts to potential customers.\\n632 \\n13. D. The best response in this case is to accept the gift because it would cause great offense\\nto the other party if you were to decline. Report the gift and the circumstances as soon as\\npossible to the appropriate parties at your company.\\n14. D. This is a conflict of interest situation, and you should report it as a violation of the\\nPMI® Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.\\n15. A. Documenting the requirements and meeting them is one of the key things you can do\\nto ensure customer satisfaction. The requirements describe what the customer is looking\\nfor, and the final product is compared against them to determine whether all of the\\nrequirements were met.\\n16. A. The most correct response is to first provide training to your team members to educate\\nthem regarding how to respect and work with others from different cultures. Colocation\\nmight not be possible when you’re working with team members from two different\\ncountries. Team-building exercises are a good idea as well but are not your first course of\\naction.\\n17. B. The situation presented here requires you to put the interest of the company and the\\nconfidentiality of the data above your own personal interests or those of your stakeholders.\\nOption D is not the most correct response because it says you believe the information is\\npublic. This implies you haven’t verified whether the data is private or public. Until you\\nknow, treat the data as confidential. In this case, the information is confidential and should\\nbe shared only with those who have a valid reason for using it.\\n18. C. As project manager, you have taken all the appropriate actions regarding confidentiality\\nof data; this question indicated that you did that. In this case, Option D is not correct\\nbecause it implies that you did not verify ahead of time that the stakeholder had the proper\\nlevels of approval to use the data.\\n19. D. Culture shock is the disoriented feeling that people might experience when working in a\\nforeign country.\\n20. A. The most appropriate response is to deny the request. Software is considered intellectual\\nproperty and should not be used for personal gain or given to others without prior consent\\nfrom the organization. This question states that the release of the beta software is handled\\nthrough the marketing department, so you should not give your friend a copy of the\\nsoftware outside of this process.'"
