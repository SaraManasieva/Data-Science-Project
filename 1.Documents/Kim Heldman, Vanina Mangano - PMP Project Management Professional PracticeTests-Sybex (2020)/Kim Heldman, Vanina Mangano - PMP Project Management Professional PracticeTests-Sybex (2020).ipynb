    "answer_text='1. B. Carina is in the process of identifying stakeholders and analyzing their level of\\ninfluence. Although the project has been active for three months, it is customary to\\nperform this activity iteratively, especially at the start of a phase.\\n2. D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, servant leadership is the practice of leading\\nthrough service to the team by focusing on developing team members and understanding\\nand addressing their needs to generate the greatest possible performance.\\n3. D. Problem-solving involves asking questions to separate the causes of the problem from\\nthe symptoms. Decision-making involves considering alternative solutions to the problem.\\nChoices are made from among the alternatives. Timing is important in decision-making,\\nbecause good decisions made too soon or too late can turn into inferior solutions.\\n4. A. The PMI Talent Triangle® consists of the following three categories of skill set:\\ntechnical project management, leadership, and strategic and business management. With\\nthe project being over budget and behind schedule, Nancy is most likely lacking in formal\\nproject management training and knowledge.\\n5. C. Negotiation is working with others to come to an agreement. Arbitration and\\nmediation are two forms of negotiation.\\n6. A, C, D. Project teams may experience many pain points when a project contains a high\\ndegree of uncertainty, change, and complexity. Agile approaches directly address these\\npain points by performing activities such as creating clear team charters (i.e., vision,\\nmission), among other activities. Examples of pain points include unclear purpose, unclear\\nrequirements, technical debt, and high defects.\\n7. B. This describes the use of interpersonal and team skills, which is a common skill set\\nused when acquiring resources. This often encompasses negotiation with other project\\nmanagers and/or managers.\\n8. A. When you hold the PMP certification, one of the responsibilities is to report violations\\nof the PMP code of conduct. In some cases, we make poor judgments that can be\\ncorrected. To maintain the integrity of the profession, everyone who holds the PMP\\ncertification must adhere to the code of conduct that makes all of us accountable to each\\nother.\\n9. D. Iterative life cycles use successive prototypes or proofs of concept to improve the\\nproduct or result. Activities are repeated in cycles to produce new information and team\\ninsights.\\n10. B. Knowledge can be split into explicit or tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge refers to\\nknowledge that is difficult to express, such as insights, experience, beliefs, and know-how.\\n11. D. This question describes the collaborate/problem-solve style of conflict resolution. This\\nstyle allows for discussion of multiple viewpoints and the examination of all perspectives\\non the issue.\\nChapter 1: People (Domain 1.0) 239\\n12. A. Withdrawal happens when one of the parties leaves and/or refuses to discuss the\\nconflict. This is a lose-lose conflict-resolution technique and does not typically result in a\\nresolution.\\n13. C, D. The team charter is used to establish the team, clarify expectations, and create team\\nnorms. It typically highlights team values, agreements, and how the team will operate\\ntogether throughout the project’s life. It may also define team ground rules and other\\nexpected behaviors.\\n14. C. This question describes activities associated with monitoring the engagement levels\\nof stakeholders. The tools and techniques used to perform these activities include data\\nanalysis, decision-making, data representation, communication skills, interpersonal and\\nteam skills, and meetings. Ground rules are used to manage stakeholder engagement.\\n15. C. Respect involves behaving in a professional manner. While project managers are\\nnot responsible for the actions of others, they are responsible for their own actions and\\nreactions. Part of acting professionally involves controlling one’s self and reactions in\\nquestionable situations, as David did in this scenario.\\n16. C. You know that your friend has reported the status untruthfully, and you are obligated\\nto ensure that the truth is reported at all times. Giving your friend an opportunity\\nto correct their behavior is appropriate; should the person not be truthful, it is your\\nresponsibility to report status based on accurate information provided.\\n17. A. Legitimate, or formal, power comes as a result of the influencer’s position.\\n18. B. General management skills are likely to affect project outcomes. Estimating Costs\\nis part of the Planning process group, and Control Costs is part of the Monitoring and\\nControlling process group. PMI requires either a degree or a certain number of years of\\nexperience in project management to sit for the exam, along with other requirements.\\n19. B. In a highly adaptive life cycle, changes are welcome. Feedback is continuously obtained\\nfrom stakeholders.\\n20. C. Roles and responsibilities, training needs, and recognition and rewards are all elements\\ndocumented in the resource management plan. Other elements covered in the plan are\\nthe list of methods for identifying resources, acquiring resources, project organizational\\ncharts, project team resource management, team development, and resource control.\\n21. D. Working in a foreign country can bring about an experience called culture shock. When\\nyou’ve spent years acting in certain ways and expecting normal, everyday events to follow\\na specific course of action, you might find yourself disoriented when things don’t go as you\\nexpected. In this scenario, the project manager was attempting to prevent culture shock.\\n22. A. Directing, also referred to as forcing, is a conflict-resolution technique where one’s\\nviewpoint is pushed at the expense of others. This is typically a win-lose solution.\\n23. D. Diversity training is the best way to ensure that team members will learn to recognize\\nand deal with cultural differences among the members because clashes could impede\\nthe project’s progress. Team-building exercises are not a bad idea, but this question is\\nspecifically asking about cultural differences, which are best handled with diversity training.\\n240 \\n24. D. The team is currently in the storming phase of Tuckman’s team development model.\\nIn this phase, the team members begin to address the project work and are not yet\\ncollaborative or open with each other.\\n25. B. Theory Z was developed by Dr. William Ouchi. This theory is concerned with\\nincreasing employee loyalty to their organizations. This theory results in increased\\nproductivity, puts an emphasis on the well-being of the employees both at work and\\noutside of work, encourages steady employment, and leads to high employee satisfaction\\nand morale.\\n26. A, B, C. Influencing entails the ability to get things done using power and politics. Power\\nis the ability to get people to do things they wouldn’t ordinarily do, and it’s the ability\\nto change minds and influence outcomes. Politics involve getting groups of people with\\ndiverse interests to cooperate creatively, even in the midst of conflict and disorder.\\n27. A-4, B-3, C-1, D-5, E-2. There are various types of leadership styles. The PMBOK® Guide\\nhighlights the following six: laissez-faire, transactional, servant leader, transformational,\\ncharismatic, and interactional. Interactional, which is not an option listed in the question,\\nrefers to a combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic.\\n28. A, D. Servant leadership enables the team to be successful by playing a supportive role,\\nallowing the team to be self-organized and self-managed. A servant leader has several\\nresponsibilities intended to empower the team; two examples include providing greater\\nteam accountability and supporting the team through mentorship and encouragement.\\n29. C. As the project progresses, you should use different techniques to perform these\\nprocesses, including using different techniques to motivate, lead, and coach. The\\ntechniques you’ll use will depend on the makeup of the project team and the stakeholders\\ninvolved in that stage. The processes in this Knowledge Area concern human and material\\nresources, and they consist of Plan Resource Management, Acquire Resources, Develop\\nTeam, Manage Team, and Control Resources.\\n30. B. Based on the little information provided in the scenario, you can conclude that Antwon\\nis the project sponsor through his title. A project sponsor is typically an executive in\\nthe organization with authority to assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the\\nproject. As a marketing associate, Lewis is least likely to be the sponsor, although it is\\npossible that he may play an important role within the project.\\n31. A. Colocation is also known as a tight matrix. These terms refer to placing many or all of\\nthe project team members physically together in the same place.\\n32. D. You must consider the characteristics of potential project team members, whether\\nthey’re from inside or outside the organization. This question describes the enterprise\\nenvironmental factors that should be considered as an input to Acquire Resources.\\n33. B. There are several methods and tools that a project manager can use to develop\\nthe project team, including colocation, virtual teams, communication technology,\\ninterpersonal and team skills (conflict management, influencing, motivation, negotiation,\\nteam building), recognition and rewards, training, individual and team assessments, and\\nmeetings. Emotional intelligence is used to manage versus develop teams.\\nChapter 1: People (Domain 1.0) 241\\n34. A. The Achievement Theory is attributed to David McClelland and says people are\\nmotivated by the need for power, achievement, and affiliation. Vroom introduced the\\nExpectancy Theory, Herzberg introduced the Hygiene Theory, and McGregor is known\\nfor Theory X and Theory Y.\\n35. A. According to the Agile Practice Guide, the servant leadership approach contains the\\nfollowing characteristics: promoting self-awareness; listening; serving those on the team;\\nhelping people grow; coaching versus controlling; promoting safety, respect, and trust;\\nand promoting the energy and intelligence of others.\\n36. B. The Contingency Theory proposes that people are motivated to achieve levels of\\ncompetency and will continue to be motivated even after the competency is reached. The\\narea of the role delineation study this question refers to is contributing to the project\\nmanagement knowledge base.\\n37. A. This question describes a manager, not a leader. The Responsibility domain covers the\\nconcept of confidential information.\\n38. D. Resource calendars are an output of the Acquire Resources process and include the\\navailability, skills, and abilities of resources.\\n39. C. In the performing phase, the team members reach the point where they are performing\\nas a well-organized unit; they are interdependent, and they work well through the issues.\\nOther options describe the forming, storming, and norming phases.\\n40. B. Within a project environment, conflict is inevitable. The key is how conflict is dealt\\nwith and managed.\\n41. C. As part of upholding the value of responsibility and ensuring integrity, project\\nmanagers are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations that apply to the\\nindustry, organization, or project. Bypassing customs is an example of violating a\\ncountry’s laws.\\n42. D. This question describes the enterprise environmental factors input of the Acquire\\nResources process and refers to the Responsibility section of the PMI Code of Ethics and\\nProfessional Conduct. Responsibility is concerned with making decisions that are for the\\ngood of the organization.\\n43. A, B, C. Good leaders use referent power, which is inferred to them by their subordinates.\\nThey are visionaries and are concerned with the big picture, or strategic direction and\\nplans. A project manager’s primary goal is to satisfy stakeholder needs.\\n44. A. You are in the Executing processes, so therefore you are in the Manage Stakeholder\\nEngagement process. This question describes the interpersonal and team skills tool and\\ntechnique for this process.\\n45. B, C, D. Recognition and rewards are often used when developing the team. Rewards\\nshould be in proportion to the achievement and linked to the performance. If you reward\\nthe same team members over and over again, it could be a morale killer for other team\\nmembers.\\n242 \\n46. C. The Expectancy Theory proposes that the expectation of a positive outcome drives\\nmotivation. Motivation may drive negative behaviors as well as positive ones. The\\nResponsibility domain covers several elements including the following: ensuring integrity,\\naccepting assignments, laws and regulations compliance, and confidential information.\\nAccepting assignments concerns being honest about your qualifications, and fudging your\\nexperience is dishonest.\\n47. C. Sometimes you might find yourself working with teams of people from different\\ncountries or cultures. Some team members might be from one country and some from\\nanother. The best way to ensure that cultural or ethical differences do not hinder your\\nproject is to provide training for all team members.\\n48. B, C, D. Virtual teams may not work in the same location, but they all share the goals of\\nthe project and have a role to fulfill.\\n49. C. The question describes activities associated with developing the team, and that’s also\\nwhere sensitivity to the stages of team development are critical.\\n50. B. According to the Agile Practice Guide, there are three common roles used in Agile\\nprojects: cross-functional team member, product owner, and team facilitator. Many Agile\\nframeworks and approaches do not address the role of project manager.\\n51. B. This question describes the Acquire Resources process because it states you will be\\nhiring virtual team members from across the globe. Virtual teams are a tool and technique\\nof this process. Because of the diversity of the team, you should pay particular attention to\\ncultural awareness and perhaps provide diversity training.\\n52. A, D. Rewards and recognition systems are formal ways of promoting desirable behavior.\\n53. D. Measuring customer satisfaction is just one of the many activities that occur during\\nadministrative closure of a project. While some projects check in and measure satisfaction\\nat key points throughout the project’s life cycle, it should occur during project closure at a\\nminimum.\\n54. D. As a project manager, it is important for you to establish relationships with the\\nstakeholders. Project Stakeholder Management is concerned with identifying all of the\\nstakeholders on the project and assessing their needs, expectations, and involvement on\\nthe project.\\n55. B, C, D. Structured interviews, ability tests, and attitudinal surveys are examples of\\nindividual and team assessments that can provide the project manager with insights into\\nteam member strengths and weaknesses. This enables them to be organized based on\\ntheir strengths. Training is not an example of an assessment.\\n56. B-4, A-2, D-1, C-3. Compromise, also known as reconcile, involves resolving conflict\\nby seeking to appease all parties involved (lose-lose outcome); collaborate is a win-win\\nconflict-resolution technique that seeks to resolve the problem through open dialogue\\nand varying perspectives; force, also known as direct, is a win-lose conflict-resolution\\ntechnique where one person is able to get their way; and avoid, also known as withdraw,\\nis a conflict-resolution technique where participants retreat from the situation in hopes\\nthat others will resolve the conflict.\\nChapter 1: People (Domain 1.0) 243\\n57. B. A servant leader encourages the distribution of responsibility across the team; they\\nsupport the team through coaching, removing blockers, helping to develop their skills, and\\nfostering collaboration.\\n58. A. A stakeholder assessment matrix allows you to compare planned engagement levels\\nagainst actual engagement levels. This can be used in conjunction with the multicriteria\\ndecision analysis technique, where predefined criteria that are prioritized and weighted\\ncan be used to assess engagement levels.\\n59. D. Leticia is performing activities associated with the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement\\nprocess. Specifically, she is using the multicriteria decision analysis tool, which is a subset\\nof the decision-making tool and technique of the process.\\n60. A. Knowledge can be split into explicit or tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge refers to\\nknowledge that can be codified using pictures, numbers, or words.\\n61. A. Team performance assessments are a result of developing the project team. This\\nactivity typically involves determining and documenting a team’s effectiveness.\\n62. A. As the project progresses, project costs begin to taper off. The project is currently in\\nthe closing stage, and risk of overspending should be minimal at this point.\\n63. A, C, D. You are carrying out activities associated with the Manage Team process.\\nThe following information will provide useful insight into team member performance:\\nresource management plan, issue log, lessons learned register, project team assignments,\\nteam charter, team performance assessments, work performance reports, enterprise\\nenvironmental factors, and organizational process assets. A project management\\ninformation system is a tool versus information that would be used to assess performance.\\n64. A. Rianna is currently performing the Manage Team process, which includes managing\\nconflict. This process is concerned with tracking team member performance, providing\\nfeedback, resolving issues, and managing team changes to optimize project performance.\\n65. A, C. According to the PMBOK® Guide, virtual teams can be defined as groups of people\\nwith a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face.\\nOftentimes, team members are dispersed across various locations.\\n66. C. You should always maintain respect and professional demeanor when interacting with\\nothers. You can’t control their actions, but you can control your own. This question refers\\nto the Conduct Procurements process. Procurement negotiation is a tool and technique of\\nthis process.\\n67. A. Collaborate is also called problem-solving and should be the technique most commonly\\nused by project managers.\\n68. D. As part of closing out a project, ongoing activities (such as support and maintenance)\\nare transitioned to the appropriate teams. When this does not occur, project resources\\ncannot be fully released from these activities.\\n69. C. Conflict-resolution techniques include the following: withdraw/avoid, smooth/\\naccommodate, compromise/reconcile, force/direct, collaborate/problem-solve.\\n244 \\n70. A. Smoothing, also known as accommodating, emphasizes areas of agreement rather than\\nareas of difference.\\n71. D. The best answer to this question is Theory Y. Theory Y managers believe people are\\ninterested in performing at their best, given the right motivation and proper expectation.\\nThey support their teams, are concerned about team members, and are good listeners.\\n72. A. The Manage Team process has two tools and techniques: interpersonal and team skills\\nand project management information system.\\n73. A-2, B-1, C-3. The PMBOK® Guide highlights three decision-making techniques: voting,\\nautocratic, and multicriteria decision analysis.\\n74. D. Theory Y managers believe that people will give you their best if they know what’s\\nexpected of them and they have the proper motivation.\\n75. A. The procurement manager’s behavior can be viewed as a conflict of interest. A conflict\\nof interest is when you put your personal interests above the interests of the project or\\nwhen you use your influence to cause others to make decisions in your favor without\\nregard for the project outcome. In other words, your personal interests take precedence\\nover your professional obligations, and you make decisions that allow you to personally\\nbenefit regardless of the outcome of the project.\\n76. C. Extinction is the best type of project ending, meaning that the project came to an end\\nbecause it was completed and accepted by the stakeholders.\\n77. B. Kaylee and Alyssa used the collaborate technique, also referred to as problem-solving.\\nThis technique involves getting multiple viewpoints from differing perspectives and\\nreaching consensus and commitment after having an open dialogue. It is considered a win-\\nwin conflict-resolution technique.\\n78. B. The best response is transformational and legitimate. This leader is focusing on\\ncollaborating and influencing. She listens to your responses and then offers suggestions\\nof her own. The situational style of leadership could have been a correct response to this\\nquestion, but it wasn’t an option. Her power of leadership is legitimate because of the\\nposition she holds.\\n79. C. While a case can be made that all of the options presented are valid answers,\\nincorrectly reporting credentials is an example of an ethics violation. As a credential\\nholder, it is your responsibility to report violations of the PMP code of conduct.\\n80. A. Trudy and Roy are using the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix tool, which\\nis part of the data representation tool and technique of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement\\nprocess. This matrix classifies stakeholders in five ways: unaware, resistant, neutral,\\nsupportive, or leading.\\n81. B. Resource leveling is used when resources are overallocated, available only at certain\\ntimes, or assigned to more than one activity at a time. This is part of resource\\noptimization techniques and a tool and technique of the Develop Schedule process.\\nChapter 1: People (Domain 1.0) 245\\n82. B. Honesty involves not only information regarding your own background and experience\\nbut information regarding the project circumstances as well. This includes being up front\\nand truthful about the project’s status and information.\\n83. B. The project manager is responsible for understanding the interests of stakeholders and\\ngetting in front of any potential conflict that may arise as a result of their personal interests.\\n84. D. The question describes a daily stand-up, referred to as a Daily Scrum meeting. These\\nmeetings are typically held at the same time and place every day and are time-boxed to\\ntypically no more than 15 minutes. The purpose is to keep the team informed and alert\\nthe Scrum master of any obstacles in the way of completing tasks.\\n85. A. Stakeholders often have conflicting interests, which can generate conflict. It is the\\nproject manager’s responsibility to understand these conflicts and try to resolve them.\\n86. A, B, C. A servant leader facilitates team success by helping the team be collaborative and\\ndeliver value more quickly. They do this by listening; promoting self-awareness, respect,\\nand trust; and adopting the mindset that they are there to serve the team.\\n87. A. The PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition defines a stakeholder as “an individual, group, or\\norganization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision,\\nactivity, or outcome of a project.”\\n88. B. Teams that are resistant to change respond better to a gradual transition where\\ncomponents of both predictive and adaptive delivery models are used. This is referred to as\\na hybrid approach.\\n89. C. Joe is correct. The project manager is responsible for managing and performing\\nactivities relating to project integration management activities.\\n90. B. Fairness includes avoiding favoritism and discrimination against others, avoiding and\\nreporting conflict-of-interest situations, and maintaining impartiality in a decision-making\\nprocess.\\n91. C. Working in a foreign country can bring about an experience called culture shock.\\nWhen you’ve spent years acting certain ways and expecting normal, everyday events to\\nfollow a specific course of action, you might find yourself disoriented when things don’t go\\nas you expected.\\n92. B. The Tuckman ladder, also referred to as stages of team development, consists of\\nfive stages that teams may go through: forming, storming, norming, performing, and\\nadjourning. In the adjourning stage, teams complete the work and are released.\\n93. C. In iterative and incremental project life cycles, feedback helps to better plan the next\\niteration of the project. In Agile projects, incremental delivery exposes requirements that\\nare hidden or misunderstood.\\n94. C. The producer is the project sponsor because the question states that he is the final\\ndecision-maker for all questions that arise on the project. He also created the budget,\\nimplying he has the authority to spend money on the project.\\n246 \\n95. B. Sue is referring to leadership skills, which is one of the categories of skill set that make\\nup the PMI Talent Triangle®. The PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition describes leadership as\\nthe knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to guide, motivate, and direct a team to help\\nan organization achieve its business goals.\\n96. B, D. Agile teams focus on measuring value and what the team delivers versus what the\\nteam predicted it would deliver. Measurements tend to be empirical and value-based in\\nnature.\\n97. D. When managing project teams, many conflicts come about as a result of scheduling\\nissues, availability of resources, or personal work habits.\\n98. D. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs notes that there are five sets of needs that must be met\\nin the following hierarchical order: basic physical needs, safety and security needs, social\\nneeds, self-esteem needs, and self-actualization. The idea is that these needs must be met\\nbefore the person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy.\\n99. A. A role delineation study (RDS) can be best described as a job analysis. PMI conducts a\\nrole delineation study every five to seven years for every discipline it credentials. An RDS\\nis conducted by bringing together volunteers to discuss the specific roles associated with\\neach certification to identify the tasks and responsibilities that the roles will be expected to\\nperform.\\n100. B. You have just completed activities associated with building the project team. Activities\\nassociated with developing the team are likely to follow.\\n101. A, B, D. The team charter, also referred to as a team’s social contract, typically addresses\\nhow the team will work together and interact. Examples provided by the Agile Practice\\nGuide include team values, working agreements, ground rules, and group norms. Team\\nassignments are not typically included within this social contract.\\n102. C. As part of our responsibility as project management practitioners, we should report\\nunethical or illegal conduct to appropriate individuals or management. Ensuring that\\nconfidentiality, regulations, and legal requirements are followed is part of upholding the\\nresponsibility value.\\n103. C. The project manager is utilizing strategic and business management skills, which is one\\nof three categories of skill set that make up the PMI Talent Triangle®. The other two are\\ntechnical project management and leadership.\\n104. C. The product owner speaks on behalf of the business unit, customer, or end user, and\\nis therefore considered to be the voice of the customer. The product owner represents\\nthe stakeholders and is the liaison between stakeholders, the Scrum master, and the\\ndevelopment team.\\n105. D. Cheryl and the project manager are engaged in capturing lessons learned in engaging\\nwith this particular vendor and also in activities associated with managing the vendor’s\\nperformance; this includes discussing what went well and what could have been done\\ndifferently, which will benefit future projects.\\nChapter 1: People (Domain 1.0) 247\\n106. B. The Hygiene Theory states that hygiene and motivators are the two factors that\\ncontribute to motivators. Hygiene factors deal with work environment issues. Motivators\\ndeal with the substance of the work itself and the satisfaction one derives from performing\\nthe functions of the job.\\n107. D. While the project sponsor is typically accountable for the project, it is the project\\nmanager who assumes responsibility for the overall success of the project.\\n108. A. Meetings are one of the four sets of tools and techniques used to develop the\\nproject management plan. Other tools and techniques include leveraging expert\\njudgment, utilizing data gathering techniques (brainstorming, checklists, focus groups,\\ninterviews), and interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, facilitation, meeting\\nmanagement).\\n109. D-3, A-4, B-2, C-1. Agile teams need a clear project vision and purpose, which are\\nprovided through a project charter.

There are three categories of skill sets that make up the PMI Talent Triangle®: business\\nmanagement and strategic skills, technical project management skills, and leadership\\nskills. Business management and strategic skills encompass a project manager being able\\nto describe the business needs of the project and how they align with the organization’s\\ngoals.\\n111. D. Responsibility includes accepting assignments that you are qualified to take on.\\nYou should always honestly report your qualifications, your experience, and your past\\nperformance of services to potential employers, customers, PMI, and others.\\n112. D. Upholding confidentiality agreements is part of the responsibility value. Protecting\\nproprietary or confidential information that has been entrusted to you is part of a project\\nmanager’s responsibility.\\n113. C. Fairness includes avoiding favoritism and discrimination against others, avoiding\\nand reporting conflict-of-interest situations, and maintaining impartiality in a decision-\\nmaking process. In this case, scope creep should be brought to the project team’s attention\\nand treated as an unapproved change. This would need to go through the formal change\\ncontrol process.\\n114. B, C, D. The underlying success factors to forming effective agile teams are building a\\nfoundational trust and safe working environment, as well as an agile mindset.\\n115. C. The Contingency Theory is a combination of Theory Y and the Hygiene Theory. It\\nstates that people are motivated to achieve levels of competency even after competency is\\nreached.\\n116. A. There are three categories of skill set that make up the PMI Talent Triangle®: business\\nmanagement and strategic skills, technical project management skills, and leadership\\nskills.\\n248 \\n117. D. Responsibility is the act of making decisions that are for the good of the organization\\nrather than ourselves, admitting our mistakes, and being responsible for the decisions we\\nmake (or those we don’t make) and the consequences that result, along with other actions.\\nIt represents one of four values that project management practitioners should uphold.\\n118. B. The salience model uses three elements in analyzing stakeholders: power, urgency, and\\nlegitimacy. This is a data representation technique of the Identify Stakeholders process.\\n119. A, C. According to the Agile Practice Guide, there are various ways for geographically\\ndistributed teams to come together via a virtual workspace. Two examples provided\\ninclude fishbowl windows and remote pairing.\\n120. D. Activities such as team building, motivating, and recognition and rewards are a means\\nof improving teamwork, motivating employees, reducing attrition, and improving overall\\nproject performance.\\n121. D. You could conduct a team celebration, thank your team members for their\\ncontributions, and guide them through a closure process.\\n122. A. This describes the adjourning stage of team development.\\n123. D. Obtaining feedback prevents the team from moving in the wrong direction. Early\\nand continuous feedback allows for microcorrections to ensure stakeholder feedback is\\nachieved and incremental value is delivered.\\n124. A. Ron is a Scrum master. In Agile project management, the Scrum master coordinates\\nthe work of the sprint and runs interference between the team and any distractions\\nthat may keep them from the work at hand. They also support the product owner in\\nmaintaining the backlog, prioritizing work, and defining when work is done.\\n125. D. The question describes technical project management skills, which is one of three\\ncategories of skill set that make up the PMI Talent Triangle®. The PMBOK® Guide –\\nSixth Edition defines technical project management skills as the knowledge, skills, and\\nbehaviors related to specific domains of project, program, and portfolio management.\\n126. C, D. Lateral thinking is a form of alternatives analysis often used to determine a project’s\\nscope. It was created by Edward de Bono and serves as a means of reasoning and thinking\\nabout problems differently than what can be classified as evident.\\n127. C. Defining the requirements and obtaining sign-off on the requirements will help\\nyou to ensure customer satisfaction. When stakeholders are aware of and agree to the\\nrequirements, they know exactly what the project is expected to deliver as well as what is\\nnot part of the deliverables.\\n128. B. Honesty and truthful reporting are required of PMP credential holders. In this\\nsituation, you would inform the customer of everything you know regarding the problem\\nand work to find alternative solutions.\\n129. D. The formula for calculating lines of communication is as follows, where n represents\\nthe total number of stakeholders (you are already assumed to have been included in the\\nnumber):\\nPlug in the numbers to get the following: 35(35 − 1) ÷ 2 = 595.\\nChapter 1: People (Domain 1.0) 249\\n130. B. The project team is using the product analysis technique to define the scope of the project.\\n131. B, C. The Agile Manifesto highlights how important individuals and their interactions\\nare. As a result, Agile approaches stress the importance of optimizing flow to achieve\\nongoing value. Key benefits include the following: people are more likely to collaborate,\\nteams produce valuable work faster, and teams waste less time.\\n132. C. Respect involves several areas, including the way we conduct ourselves, the way we\\ntreat others, listening to other viewpoints, and conducting ourselves in a professional\\nmanner. According to the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, an environment\\nof respect generates trust and confidence and fosters mutual cooperation.\\n133. B. When people work in unfamiliar environments, culture shock can occur. Training and\\nresearching information about the country you’ll be working in can help counteract this.\\n134. C. A burndown chart shows the time remaining for the sprint and displays the time\\nperiod of the sprint on the horizontal axis and the backlog items on the vertical axis.\\n135. B. Trudy and Roy are carrying out activities associated with planning stakeholder\\nengagement, which involves developing the approaches to engage stakeholders based on\\ntheir interests, impact on the project, needs, and expectations.\\n136. C. Expert power occurs when someone has a considerable amount of knowledge about a\\nsubject or has special abilities.\\n137. A. Engaging in development activities for the team allows the project manager to improve\\nteam competencies, team member interaction, and the overall team environment to\\nenhance project performance.\\n138. C. The project manager is performing activities related to the Manage Stakeholder\\nEngagement process. Interpersonal and team skills, a tool and technique of this process,\\ninvolves cultural awareness.\\n139. A. These team members are confrontational with each other and are trying to find their\\nposition within the team and their standing with you. This describes the storming stage of\\nteam development.\\n140. C. This question describes a transactional leadership style. Transactional leaders are\\nautocratic, activity focused, and autonomous; they use contingent reward systems and\\nmanage by exception.\\n141. C. While all options listed may help the situation, interpersonal and team skills is the\\nprominent area that the offending team member lacks.\\n142. D. The most appropriate response is to tell the customer about the remaining tasks and\\nwork with them to modify the schedule date or modify the agreement regarding the\\npayment date.\\n143. B. A conflict of interest is when you put your personal interests above the interests of the\\nproject or when you use your influence to cause others to make decisions in your favor\\nwithout regard for the project outcome. Violating the procurement policy to improve the\\nbudget situation was not the appropriate action to take.\\n250 \\n144. A. When building your team, it is important to consider things such as the organization’s\\nrecruitment and procurement procedures and processes. You hired your friend on the\\nspot, so important steps in the process could have been missed. Pre-assignment is when\\nresources are assigned prior to the project start.\\n145. A. The formula for calculating lines of communication is as follows, where n represents\\nthe total number of stakeholders (you are already assumed to have been included in the\\nnumber):\\nn (n – 1) ÷ 2\\nPlug in the numbers to get the following: 12(12 − 1) ÷ 2 = 66\\n146. B. Expert power occurs when the person being influenced believes the person doing the\\ninfluencing, typically because they are knowledgeable about the subject or have special\\nabilities that make them an expert.\\n147. C. The stages of team development are as follows: forming, storming, norming, and\\nperforming. This model was developed by Tuckman-Jensen, and whenever a new member\\nis added, the team reverts to the forming stage of development.\\n148. A. This team member is describing the self-actualization level of Maslow’s Hierarchy of\\nNeeds.\\n149. B. Given that the project manager contributed to the handbook while under assignment\\nby the contracting organization and was just one of multiple contributors, it is likely that\\nhis actions would be viewed as a violation of the organization’s policies on intellectual\\nproperty. This would be verified by reviewing the project manager’s contractual\\nagreement.\\n150. B. Rather than asking how the team can act in a predictable manner, a team looking\\nto adopt an Agile mind-set may instead ask how the team can act in a more Agile or\\ntransparent manner.'"

    "answer_text='1. B. Rita is in the process of refining the backlog in order to prepare for the next iteration.\\nEngaging the team allows everyone to be aligned on the stories, relative to one another.\\n2. C. The project manager is typically responsible for authoring the final report. The\\nproject’s final report contains a summary of what occurred on the project and may include\\ninformation on scope, cost, schedule/burn down of work, risk, and quality outcomes.\\n3. B. Risk strategy, methodology, and risk-related roles and responsibilities are all elements\\nof the risk management plan. Other areas covered by the plan include the following:\\nrisk-related funding, timing, risk categories, stakeholder risk appetite, definitions of risk\\nprobability and impacts, probability and impact matrix, reporting formats, and tracking.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 251\\n4. C. The Agile Manifesto identifies 12 principles that describe the Agile approach. It came\\nabout through a group of software developers who came together in 2001 to formalize the\\nAgile approach.\\n5. C. According to PMI, a good project manager spends up to 90 percent of their time\\ncommunicating. Communication skills are essential for a successful project manager.\\n6. A. Change-driven life cycles are also known as Agile or adaptive life cycles.\\n7. B. Project Communications Management involves every member of the project team,\\nincluding all the stakeholders. Everyone involved in the project will send or receive project\\ninformation or both. Project Resources involve all the human and physical resources\\nassigned to the work of the project. Although all the folks working on the project are\\ninvolved, only the project manager and perhaps a few others are involved in performing\\nthe processes within this Knowledge Area.\\n8. A, C, D. A highly predictive (waterfall) life cycle typically has detailed specifications,\\nwhile a highly adaptive life cycle (Agile) has requirements that are progressively\\nelaborated. All other statements are true.\\n9. A-5, B-1, C-4, D-2, E-3. There are a total of 10 Project Management Knowledge Areas.\\nThe best indicator of its description is identifying key words that tie it back to the name of\\nthe Knowledge Area.\\n10. A, C. According to the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, you should always\\nreport the truth regarding project status. This question refers to activities associated with\\nthe Manage Communications process.\\n11. B. Using an Agile approach, a project team can assess results and adjust processes to meet\\nnew or modified requirements.\\n12. B. Incremental life cycles focus on speed of delivery as an optimization method. In this\\ntype of life cycle, the project yields frequent smaller deliverables to avoid waiting for\\neverything to be completed before a solution exists. In other words, a subset of the overall\\nsolution becomes available sooner.\\n13. B. Since the scenario outlined that the final deliverable of the project was completed,\\nit implies that closing activities would follow. Administrative closure, which occurs as\\npart of the Close Project or Phase process, consists of activities such as ensuring that exit\\ncriteria have been met and contractual agreements were properly closed out, measuring\\nstakeholder satisfaction, and ensuring that ongoing operational or sustainment activities\\nare transferred to operations.\\n14. B. In Scrum, iterations are also known as sprints. Iterations or sprints are always time-\\nbound and can be any short period of time defined and agreed upon by the team.\\n15. D. The milestone list contains the final dates that the project milestones have been\\naccomplished. This is used as an input to the Close Project or Phase process, which is\\nwhere the final report is produced.\\n252 \\n16. C. Project communications is an input of the Close Project or Phase process as part of\\nproject documents. It includes all communications that have been generated throughout\\nthe project.\\n17. B. The project team is performing administrative closure activities associated with the\\nClose Project or Phase process. While information captured will be added to the lessons\\nlearned register, administrative closure is a broader choice that captures additional\\nactivities noted in the question, such as archiving information and creating the final report.\\n18. B. According to the Agile Practice Guide, all project life cycles share the element of\\nplanning. What differs across predictive, iterative, incremental, and Agile life cycles is the\\ndegree to which planning is done, and when.\\n19. B, C. Remember that all questions on the exam will refer to specific terminology used\\nin the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition. Although the other options presented may seem\\ncorrect, the PMBOK® Guide calls this process by any of these names: stage gates, phase\\nreviews, phase gates, phase exit, or kill points.\\n20. C. The Monitoring and Controlling process group is where project performance\\nmeasurements are taken and analyzed to determine whether the project is progressing\\naccording to the plan.\\n21. D. Agile project management is a methodology that manages projects through iterations\\nof work; it allows the team to quickly adapt to new requirements and allows for continual\\nassessment of goals, deliverables, and functionality of the product, service, or result of the\\nproject.\\n22. D. Within the Agile methodology, a sprint or iteration refers to a short, time-bound\\nperiod of work, which always starts with a sprint-planning meeting. It is also known as an\\niteration.\\n23. D. A project is considered successful when it achieves its objectives and the stakeholder\\nneeds and expectations are met.\\n24. A. Information included within the project charter is high level versus detailed. While\\nthe charter may include a list of high-level risks, it is unlikely that a detailed list can be\\ncompiled at this early stage of the project.\\n25. A. The chances for successful completion during the Executing phase are medium to high.\\nSince the project is nearing the end of execution and is currently on track, the likelihood\\nof success is high.\\n26. A. There are two types of risk acceptance in which no proactive risk response strategy is\\nselected: passive and active acceptance. Passive acceptance means that no action will be\\ntaken other than to periodically monitor the risk.\\n27. C. The project manager is putting together the cost management plan, which is an activity\\ncarried out through the Plan Cost Management process. The cost management plan\\ndocuments the rules of performance measurement, level of precision and accuracy, units of\\nmeasure, organizational procedures links, control thresholds, reporting formats, process\\ndescriptions, and other budget-related details necessary to develop, manage, and control\\nthe budget.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 253\\n28. B. Appraisal costs are associated with the cost of quality and are the costs expended\\nto examine the product or process and make certain the requirements are being met.\\nInspection and testing are examples of appraisal costs.\\n29. B. The best answer is the communications management plan, which is a subsidiary of\\nthe project management plan. While project management plan is also a correct answer,\\nthe communications management plan is a more specific choice and therefore a better\\nanswer. Stakeholder communication requirements, escalation processes, and methods for\\nreceiving/obtaining information are all elements addressed within the communications\\nmanagement plan.\\n30. B, C, D. The product scope description is a component of the project charter and of the\\nproject scope statement, but it is not an input to this process.\\n31. A, B, D. This statement does describe some objectives but not adequately. Objectives\\nare quantifiable criteria used to measure project success and should include schedule,\\ncost, and quality metrics. There are no measures of time, cost, or quality mentioned in\\nthis statement. Requirements describe the specifications of the objectives and typically\\nwouldn’t be mixed into an objective statement. The objective should be clear and concise.\\n32. C. As part of carrying out the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process, updates are\\nmade to the risk register. Among the updates are an assessment of overall project risk\\nexposure and detailed probabilistic analysis of the project.\\n33. B. To determine the total duration of the project, you add up the expected value for each\\nactivity. Note, you calculate expected value only for activities that have zero float.\\n34. A. Philip Crosby is the quality theorist behind the Zero Defects practice, which promotes\\ndoing it right the first time.\\n35. B. Carina is performing the Identify Risks process. The purpose of the process is to\\nidentify individual project risks, as well as sources of overall project risk, and document\\ntheir characteristics.\\n36. A. Low-priority risks are added to a watch list within the risk register, where they will be\\nmonitored for possible changes.\\n37. A. There are 10 channels of communication, which is taken into consideration when using\\nthe communications requirement analysis tool and technique of the Plan Communications\\nManagement process. The formula for this is 5(5 − 1) ÷ 2.\\n38. B. The greatest expense for most projects is resources, both human and material and\\nsupplies.\\n39. C. Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the\\nquantity of work by the rate or uses an algorithm in conjunction with historical data to\\ndetermine cost, budget, or duration estimates. When the information is reliable, it yields\\nan estimate that is high in accuracy.\\n40. C. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are two levels of risk: individual project risk\\nand overall project risk. An overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project\\nas a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty.\\n254 \\n41. B. The funding requirements are derived from the cost baseline. Management reserve is\\nreleased in increments throughout the project, and the funding requirements are an output\\nof the Determine Budget process.\\n42. D. Make-or-buy analysis is a tool and technique of the Plan Procurement Management\\nprocess.\\n43. D. The Daily Scrum is intended to keep the team functioning on the same page,\\nmicrocommit to each other, and address any impediments immediately. In her role as\\nScrum master, Chu attends to support the team and ensure they understand their roles and\\nScrum processes.\\n44. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the purpose of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement\\nprocess is to develop approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their needs,\\nexpectations, interests, and potential impacts on the project. This is the second process of\\nthe Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area.\\n45. B. Direct and Manage Project Work, Manage Quality, and Conduct Procurements are 3\\nof the 10 processes that make up the Executing process group.\\n46. D. During Closing, a project has the highest probability of completing successfully.\\n47. D. Since EAC is based on actual costs to date and assuming ETC work will be completed\\nat the budgeted rate, the equation to use for EAC is EAC = AC + (BAC – EV). In this case,\\nyour formula looks like this: $425 + ($900 – $475) = $850.\\n48. B. The project management plan contains the resource management plan, which addresses\\nhow resources will be obtained, managed, and released.\\n49. C. An Agile life cycle consists of a blend of iterative and incremental approaches, which\\nfocuses on refining the work to deliver outcomes more frequently. An Agile life cycle has\\ndynamic requirements that focus on customer value.\\n50. C. Integration occurs when the resources of the project are distributed to other areas in\\nthe organization or are assigned to other projects. In this case, the functional manager is\\nreassigning resources to another project.\\n51. C. Waterfall is a methodology that follows a predictive life cycle. While there are many\\nAgile and Lean frameworks, the Agile Practice Guide addresses the following: Scrum,\\neXtreme Programming, Kanban Method, Crystal Methods, Scrumban, Feature-Driven\\nDevelopment, Dynamic Systems Development Method, and Agile Unified Process.\\n52. B. Reserve analysis is a technique used as part of the Control Costs and Monitor Risks\\nprocess. This technique involves the analysis of how much reserves have been consumed to\\ndate and whether sufficient reserves remain to address current and future risks.\\n53. C. Data analysis is a tool and technique of multiple project management processes,\\nincluding the Control Schedule process, where it encompasses the use of earned value\\nanalysis, iteration burndown charts, performance reviews, trend analysis, variance\\nanalysis, and what-if scenario analysis.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 255\\n54. B. Planned value is the authorized budget assigned to the scheduled work; in other words,\\nit refers to the value of the work to be completed.\\n55. C. Status review meetings are considered one of the most important types of meetings\\na project manager holds throughout the project. These types of meetings use interactive\\ncommunication, where communication occurs between stakeholders and is live.\\n56. B. When performing activities relating to controlling resources, data analysis may be used\\nto evaluate what alternatives exist to completing activities with resources, such as alternate\\nresources. Data analysis also includes performing cost-benefit analysis, performance\\nreviews, and trend analysis.\\n57. C. An iteration burndown chart is a data analysis tool and technique of the Control\\nSchedule process. This chart is used to track the remaining work to be completed against\\nthe backlog.\\n58. B. If the critical path tasks have variances, your schedule is at risk. You will use corrective\\nactions at this point (not preventive actions) to get the project back on track, such as\\nadjusting the amount of buffer. Significant delays to noncritical-path tasks can make them\\nbecome part of the critical path.\\n59. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, scope creep refers to the uncontrolled expansion of\\nproduct or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources; in other words,\\nit is scope that has not been approved.\\n60. A. To determine performance against the budget, you must first calculate variance at\\ncompletion. To calculate variance at completion, subtract the estimate at completion from\\nthe budget at completion (BAC – EAC): $550,000 – $525,000 = $25,000. A positive VAC\\nmeans that the project is performing under the planned costs.\\n61. A, B, D. Scope changes might affect the schedule, cost, quality, and other processes and\\nshould be thoroughly integrated with all the Monitoring and Controlling processes. Scope\\nchanges may reduce the project requirements and thus reduce the number or hours needed\\nto complete the project. This, in turn, could cause a reduction in the project budget.\\n62. B. Work performance information is a key input that the project manager needs\\nto evaluate performance against the plan (another key input in and of itself). Work\\nperformance data, on the other hand, represents raw data that is used in executing the\\nwork; it later becomes information as it is analyzed against baselines through other\\nprocesses that belong to the Monitoring and Controlling process group. The remaining\\ntwo options are tools and techniques of the process, not inputs.\\n63. A-1, B-4, C-3, D-2. There are generally three types of delivery methods: predictive,\\nadaptive, and hybrid. Another layer to consider is the project life cycle, of which there are\\ngenerally four: predictive, iterative, incremental, and Agile.\\n64. B. In a predictive life cycle, the project’s scope, time, and cost are determined during\\nthe early phases of the project, meaning that the majority of planning occurs up front.\\nChanges are closely managed following a change control process.\\n256 \\n65. B. Status review meetings occur throughout the Monitoring and Controlling phase\\nof the project. The purpose of these meetings is to provide stakeholders with updated\\ninformation on the progress of the project in a formal manner. Attendees may include a\\nvariety of predetermined stakeholders, such as the sponsor, project team members, users, or\\ncustomers.\\n66. B. Identify Stakeholders belongs to the Project Stakeholder Management Knowledge Area.\\nThe Project Integration Management Knowledge Area contains the following processes:\\nDevelop Project Charter, Develop Project Management Plan, Direct and Manage\\nProject Work, Manage Project Knowledge, Monitor and Control Project Work, Perform\\nIntegrated Changed Control, and Close Project or Phase.\\n67. D. Face-to-face meetings are effective, but this statement is not true regarding status\\nreview meetings.\\n68. A. Fixed-price incentive fee contracts are the best option when you need a well-defined set\\nof deliverables for a set price and are including a bonus or incentive for early completion\\nor exceeding expectations.\\n69. B. Completing a quality audit may lead you to the conclusion that a change request is\\nneeded, but you must submit a change request and/or take corrective action to implement\\nthe quality improvement.\\n70. C. Managing quality is sometimes referred to as quality assurance. Manage Quality is\\na process within the Project Quality Management Knowledge Area. According to the\\nPMBOK® Guide, the term manage quality is meant to encompass a broader meaning,\\nincluding representing nonproject work.\\n71. C. The project manager is using a highly adaptive (Agile) life cycle, where Closing\\nactivities involve addressing the highest business value items first versus closing out the\\nproject or phase as in a highly predictive life cycle.\\n72. B. The risk register contains the list of identified risks and all information documented\\nabout them, including the risk response plans. As risk triggers occur, they will need to\\nrefer to the risk register for information about the risk response plans.\\n73. A. This process is used only if you are obtaining goods and services outside the\\norganization.\\n74. C. Quality assurance may be provided by a third party from outside the organization,\\nby an internal QA department, or by the project team. There is no general rule that it\\nis generally provided by outside sources. According to the PMBOK® Guide, project\\nmanagers have the greatest impact on quality during this process.\\n75. B. Project Scope Management is concerned with product scope and project scope. Product\\nscope is concerned with the characteristics of the product or service of the project and is\\nmeasured against the project requirements. Project scope is concerned with the work of\\nthe project and is measured against the project plan.\\n76. B. In 2001, several software developers converged to formalize the Agile approach. They\\npublished the manifesto for Agile software development and identified 12 principles that\\nare the focus of any Agile approach.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 257\\n77. B. The PMBOK® Guide addresses four project life cycles: predictive, iterative,\\nincremental, and Agile.\\n78. B. The question describes activities associated with risk management. Kaylee and Alyssa\\nare determining how best to address a positive risk (opportunity) that has been identified.\\n79. B. In an Agile life cycle, Planning activities involve the progressive elaboration of scope,\\nbased on continuous feedback from stakeholders.\\n80. C. Fast-tracking refers to compressing or shortening the project schedule. In this scenario,\\nyou are attempting to compress the phase.\\n81. B. The question describes a sprint retrospective meeting, which helps the team plan for\\nthe next sprint and determine overall progress.\\n82. A. Yasmin is using a Waterfall approach, which involves a greater level of up-front\\nplanning during the early stages of the project life cycle. In this approach, changes to\\nrequirements tend to follow a change control process.\\n83. B. There are three network paths: A-B-E, A-C-E, and A-D-E. Figure 2.1 shows the\\nnetwork diagram for the information displayed within the table of the question. The\\nduration value is not needed to calculate the answer.\\nFigurE 2.1 Network diagram: network path calculation\\nActivity Name:\\nB\\nDuration: 2\\nActivity Name: Activity Name: Activity Name:\\nA C E\\nDuration: 5 Duration: 10 Duration: 2\\nActivity Name:\\nD\\nDuration: 7\\n84. B. To calculate the critical path (which is the longest path through the network diagram),\\nadd the duration of activities that fall within each network path. The path with the\\ngreatest duration is the critical path. Figure 2.2 shows the network diagram, based on the\\ninformation provided within the table. The duration of each network path is as follows:\\nA-B-E: 9\\nA -C-E: 17\\nA -D-E: 14\\n258 \\nFigurE 2.2 Network diagram: critical path calculation\\nActivity Name:\\nB\\nDuration: 2\\nActivity Name: Activity Name: Activity Name:\\nA C E\\nDuration: 5 Duration: 10 Duration: 2\\nActivity Name:\\nD\\nDuration: 7\\n85. C. To calculate the near critical path (which is the second longest path through the\\nnetwork diagram), add the duration of activities that fall within each network path. The\\npath with the second greatest duration is the near critical path. Figure 2.3 shows the\\nnetwork diagram, based on the information provided within the table. The duration of\\neach network path is as follows:\\nA -B-E: 9\\nA -C-E: 17\\nA -D-E: 14\\nFigurE 2.3 Network diagram: near critical path calculation\\nActivity Name:\\nB\\nDuration: 2\\nActivity Name: Activity Name: Activity Name:\\nA C E\\nDuration: 5 Duration: 10 Duration: 2\\nActivity Name:\\nD\\nDuration: 7\\n86. D. Purchasing insurance is an example of the transfer risk response. This involves shifting\\nownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to own the impact if the\\nthreat occurs.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 259\\n87. C. The project objectives should include quantifiable criteria that can be used to help\\nmeasure project success. Project objectives should include schedule, cost, and quality\\nmeasurements.\\n88. C. The purpose of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is to prioritize individual\\nproject risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and\\nimpact as well as other characteristics.\\n89. A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3. Philip Crosby is the quality theorist behind the Zero Defects practice,\\nwhich promotes doing it right the first time; Joseph Juran popularized the Pareto Principle,\\nalso referred to as the 80/20 principle; and W. Edwards Deming popularized the Shewhart\\nCycle, which he evolved into the Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle. Walter Shewhart is considered\\nto be the grandfather of TQM; he developed statistical tools to examine when a corrective\\naction must be applied to a process.\\n90. B. Email is a form of push communication, which is one-way and refers to sending\\ninformation to the intended receivers.\\n91. D. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product, including actions,\\nprocesses, data, and interactions that the product should execute.\\n92. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are two levels of risk: individual project risk\\nand overall project risk. An individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that,\\nif it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.\\n93. B. Three-point estimating is the technique to use when you want to improve your\\nestimates and account for risk and estimation uncertainty.\\n94. D. To calculate schedule variance, subtract planned value from earned value (CV = EV –\\nAC): $500 – $450 = $50. A positive cost variance means that the project is under budget.\\n95. D. One of the benefits of Agile approaches is the ability to obtain feedback continuously\\nthroughout the project. This allows the team to incorporate the feedback early.\\n96. D. You should develop a mitigation plan for installation and setup to reduce the\\nprobability and/or impact of this risk to the project. Option A is not correct because the\\nsharing response strategy is a strategy for positive risks. This is a negative risk to the\\nproject.\\n97. C. Tracking includes a description of how you’ll document the history of the risk activities\\nfor the current project and how the risk processes will be audited. This section of the risk\\nmanagement plan is also helpful for lessons learned.\\n98. A, D. The procurement SOW can be prepared by either the buyer or the seller, but it is\\nprogressively elaborated throughout the procurement processes and will likely change\\nprior to the contract award.\\n99. A. The project team is participating in bottom-up estimating, which will produce\\nactivity cost estimates. This activity is associated with the Estimate Costs process. Basis\\nof estimates may also be generated through this session; cost estimates, however, are the\\nprimary end outcome of the activity.\\n260 \\n100. B. Hybrid life cycles combine elements of different life cycles to achieve a certain goal. A\\nhybrid approach may contain a combination of iterative, predictive, incremental, and/or\\nAgile approaches.\\n101. A. The sponsor is requesting the earned value of the project. Earned value represents the\\nmeasure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work; in\\nother words, it is the sum of the planned value of completed work.\\n102. C. Reserve analysis is a data analysis technique of the Monitor Risks process. Reserve\\nanalysis compares the amount of contingency reserve remaining to address the risk that\\nremains. Contingency reserves (used to deal with known risks) are considered part of\\nthe project budget, while management reserves (used to deal with unknown risks)\\nare not.\\n103. B. To calculate EAC when the future work will be accomplished at the planned rate, use\\nthe following formula: AC + BAC – EV. Plug in the values provided in the question to\\narrive at the following: $15,000 + $20,000 – $18,000 = $17,000.\\n104. C. The elements of communication involve senders, receivers, and messages. The\\ncommunication model, a tool and technique of the Manage Communications process,\\nincludes encoding, decoding, acknowledging, and feedback/response. Verbal and written\\nare forms of communication.\\n105. D. The scenario notes that two critical activities are already delayed, meaning that an\\nissue has been identified and must be addressed. While updates to the plan are likely, they\\nwill be the result of corrective action taken.\\n106. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, quality assurance is most concerned with using\\nproject processes effectively. This includes assuring stakeholders that the end result of the\\nproject will meet their needs and expectations.\\n107. A, C, D. The requisition stage is where the procurement documents are prepared (not the\\nresponses to them) and is associated with the Plan Procurement Management process.\\nThe two outputs that become inputs are procurement documentation and source selection\\ncriteria.\\n108. D. The project team members, project manager, and the stakeholders are all equally\\nresponsible for the quality assurance of the project.\\n109. C. One of the most important criteria for evaluating sellers is to determine whether they\\nhave a clear understanding of what you’re asking them to do or perform. Information\\nsuch as past performance, financial records, and predetermined performance criteria are\\nalso important, but only after you are sure they have a clear understanding of what you’re\\nasking them to do.\\n110. A. A sprint retrospective is held at the end of an iteration/sprint to identify what the\\nteam learned over the last sprint, including what went well and what did not. The intent\\nis to continue improving the overall process so that the team continues to become more\\neffective as a unit.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 261\\n111. B. The lessons learned register, created out of the Manage Project Knowledge process,\\nrecords information about situations that have occurred within the project, including\\nrecording challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, and other information\\nrelevant for future reference. While “project documents” is a technically accurate answer,\\n“lessons learned register” is a more specific answer.\\n112. D. The Manage Communications process is concerned with ensuring timely and\\nappropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, monitoring,\\nand the ultimate disposition of project information.\\n113. B. The five steps of decomposition are to identify major deliverables, organize the WBS,\\ndecompose the WBS components into lower-level components, assign identification codes,\\nand validate the WBS. No mention was made in the question of assigning identification\\ncodes or validating the correctness of decomposition, so not all of the steps have been\\nperformed. The first three steps of the decomposition process for the Design deliverable\\nhave been performed.\\n114. A. The project scope statement contains the project scope description, project\\ndeliverables, acceptance criteria, and project exclusions.\\n115. B. This question describes an iteration review meeting, which can go by other names\\nsuch as sprint demo. The intent of the meeting is to review the working product to obtain\\nfeedback directly from the product owner and other key stakeholders early so that any course\\ncorrections can be made. In iteration-based Agile, this meeting is held at the end of a sprint/\\niteration, whereas flow-based Agile encourages reviews to occur at least once every two weeks.\\n116. B. Marysil will need to add a lag between the activities. A lag occurs when time must\\nelapse between two activities, where the delay is added to the successor activity. A lead, on\\nthe other hand, speeds up the successor activity.\\n117. C. The product scope defines the features and characteristics that describe the product,\\nservice, or result of the project.\\n118. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, a definitive range of estimates is −5 percent to\\n+10 percent.\\n119. D. Carrie used the analogous estimating technique, which is a form of expert judgment. It\\nis a tool and technique of the Estimate Activity Durations process. Analogous estimating\\nbases estimates on previous activities that are similar in fact, and they require the person\\nestimating them to have expertise in the activity. Analogous estimating techniques are\\ntypically used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of information\\nabout the project.\\n120. C. Schedule compression shortens the project schedule without changing the project\\nscope. Crashing doesn’t always give you a good alternative and typically increases project\\ncosts. Fast-tracking typically increases risk and necessitates rework.\\n121. D. The duration of a milestone is zero, marking a significant point in time—typically the\\nstart or completion of a major deliverable. Therefore, “Finish GUI” is not a milestone.\\n262 \\n122. A. A fallback plan, also referred to as a contingency plan, is a risk response strategy that\\nis used when the initial response is not fully effective.\\n123. C. When using price alone as a criterion for selection, there should be more than one\\nvendor who can supply the goods or services you are procuring. However, that doesn’t\\nmean you can’t use additional criteria for source selection. You should include costs such\\nas delivery and setup in the purchase price criterion.\\n124. A-1, B-4, C-2, D-3. The definitions provided are taken from Agile Practice Guide.\\n125. C. This question describes the Manage Communications and Manage Stakeholder\\nEngagement processes, respectively. There is no process called Information Distribution.\\n126. D. Since an issue has not occurred as of yet, the project manager is likely to take\\npreventive actions. Preventive actions are submitted through a change request, which is\\nthen evaluated and dispositioned through the project’s change control board.\\n127. A. Claims administration is a tool and technique of the Control Procurements process.\\nClaims administration involves addressing contested changes between the buyer and seller,\\nwhich then converts into a claim.\\n128. D. Swarming is a strategy where the team, or several team members, focus collectively on\\nresolving a blocker.\\n129. B. Weekly status updates are an example of work performance reports, which are\\nproduced out of the Monitor and Control Project Work process.\\n130. B. The Project Integration Management Knowledge Area is the only Knowledge Area that\\nhas processes across all five process groups. It contains the high-level processes that bring\\nthe results of the remaining Knowledge Areas together, unifying and coordinating all\\nproject management activities.\\n131. D. Julie is looking at a product backlog, which contains a prioritized list of user-centric\\nrequirements that she and the team maintain for the smart water bottle product.\\n132. B. The cost management plan contains the approved approach for determining the\\nbudget, managing it, and controlling it. It also captures additional key details, such as\\nthe rules of performance measurement, control thresholds, units of measure and levels of\\nprecision used, and so on.\\n133. C. Schedule compression uses fast-tracking or crashing compression techniques to bring\\ndelayed activities back in line with the plan. Allocating additional resources to critical\\nactivities describes the crashing technique; fast-tracking is where you complete two\\nactivities in parallel in order to complete the work faster.\\n134. C. The project manager is performing the Validate Scope process in this scenario, where\\na key output is the accepted deliverables. To accept deliverables, the committee would\\nneed to confirm that they have been verified through quality control activities. Verified\\ndeliverables is an input of the process.\\nChapter 2: Process (Domain 2.0) 263\\n135. A. Backlog refinement, also referred to as backlog grooming, is where the product owner\\nworks with the team to ensure that the stories are prepped and ready for the upcoming\\niteration. Stories should be clear enough for the team to understand the work, and they\\nshould be appropriately sized relative to each other.\\n136. A. Management reserves are funds set aside for unexpected situations and are used at the\\ndiscretion of management (hence the name). Management reserves are not considered to\\nbe part of the cost baseline but are part of the overall project budget.\\n137. C. A rough order of magnitude ranges from –25 percent to +75 percent, whereas a\\ndefinitive range spans –5 percent to +10 percent.\\n138. B. The recommended size of an Agile team is three to nine team members. It is\\nrecommended that Agile teams be colocated and dedicated to the project when possible.\\n139. A. Statistical sampling involves taking a sample number of parts from the whole\\npopulation and inspecting them to determine whether they fall within acceptable\\nvariances.\\n140. C. A beta distribution calculation involves giving a greater weight to the most likely\\nestimate. Simply multiply the most likely estimate by four, add the result with the other\\ntwo estimates, and divide by six: (4 × (ML) $72 + (O) $55 + (P) $85) ÷ 6 = $71.3.\\n141. A-5, B-1, C-4, D-2, E-3. There are many variations of Agile approaches, including hybrid/\\ncombination approaches (i.e., ScrumBan). Descriptions provided are derived from the\\nAgile Practice Guide, which offers several descriptions and examples of a wide range of\\nAgile approaches.\\n142. A-3, B-2, C-1, D-4. Predictive and iterative life cycles tend to have low frequencies of\\ndelivery, whereas incremental and agile have a high frequency of finished deliverables;\\nboth predictive and incremental experience few changes, while iterative and Agile\\nexperience very frequent changes based on customer feedback.\\n143. A. The purpose of the daily stand-up meetings, one of three key meetings used within\\nScrum, is not planning. Instead, daily stand-up meetings are used to uncover any obstacles\\nto committed work and as a way to ensure that work is progressing smoothly.\\n144. C, D. The Scrum team held a sprint retrospective. In Scrum, this meeting is held at the end of\\nevery sprint and allows the team to identify what went well in the process during the recent\\nsprint and what could have gone better, and they commit to improving at least one thing in\\nthe upcoming sprint. They are a combination of lessons learned and process improvement.\\n145. D. Velocity refers to the total story points that the team is completing on average per\\niteration. Velocity allows the team to forecast the rate at which they are burning down\\nthe work of the project. A velocity chart shows the sum of the estimates of work delivered\\nacross all iterations.\\n146. A. The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle was developed by Shewhart and later refined by Deming.\\nIt reflects the iterative, results-oriented, and interactive nature of the project process groups.\\n264 \\n147. A. There are three series of project life cycles within the basic framework for managing\\nprojects: sequential, iterative, and overlapping. In a sequential life cycle, one phase must\\nfinish before the next phase can begin.\\n148. B. Phase endings are characterized by the completion, review, and approval of a\\ndeliverable.\\n149. A. The PMBOK® Guide describes 49 project management processes that can be grouped\\nin five process groups, which are as follows: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring\\nand Controlling, and Closing.\\n150. C. Agile project management is a method of managing projects in small, incremental\\nportions of work that can be easily assigned, easily managed, and completed within a\\nshort period of time.'"

       "'\\n\\n147. A. There are three series of project life cycles within the basic framework for managing\\nprojects: sequential, iterative, and overlapping. In a sequential life cycle, one phase must\\nfinish before the next phase can begin.\\n148. B. Phase endings are characterized by the completion, review, and approval of a\\ndeliverable.\\n149. A. The PMBOK® Guide describes 49 project management processes that can be grouped\\nin five process groups, which are as follows: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring\\nand Controlling, and Closing.\\n150. C. Agile project management is a method of managing projects in small, incremental\\nportions of work that can be easily assigned, easily managed, and completed within a\\nshort period of time.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment\\n(Domain 3.0)\\n1. B. The business case is an economic feasibility study used to understand the business need\\nfor the project and determine whether the investment is worthwhile. In short, it justifies\\nthe need for the project and contains information such as the project description, high-\\nlevel description of scope, analysis of the problem, financial analysis, and success factors.\\n2. B. Project management is defined as the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and\\ntechniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.\\n3. D. Since the marketing company where Bill works is a customer of Reasons to Lyv, the\\nproject being managed within his organization is a result of a customer request.\\n4. D. Respect, not fairness, is the value that addresses culture shock and diversity training.\\nAccepting vendor gifts is acceptable when the gift or situation complies with a company’s\\nstated policies.\\n5. D. All the options are part of the organizational process assets updates output of this\\nprocess. Feedback from stakeholders can be used on the current project as well as future\\nprojects.\\n6. D. The best answer to this question is D. This is a high-risk project, and a feasibility study\\nshould be conducted as a separate project because the outcome is unknown.\\n7. A. Don’t accept gifts that might be construed as conflicts of interest. If your organization\\ndoes not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for yourself depending on the\\nsituation, the history of gift acceptance by the organization in the past, and the complexity\\nof the project. It’s always better to decline a gift you’re unsure about than to accept it and\\nlater lose your credibility, your reputation, or your PMP status because of bad judgment.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 265\\n8. B. Marketplace conditions and financial management and accounts payable systems are\\nexamples of enterprise environmental factors versus organizational process assets. When\\nperforming the Close Project or Phase process, project or phase closure guidelines or\\nrequirements, along with the configuration management knowledge base, serve as valuable\\ninputs. The configuration management knowledge base contains versions and baselines of\\nstandards, policies, procedures, and project documents belonging to the organization.\\n9. B. Linear, multi-objective programming, and nonlinear are all examples of constrained\\noptimization methods, not benefit measurement methods. Benefit measurement methods\\ninclude benefit-cost ratio analysis, scoring models, and benefit contribution methods.\\n10. D. Project selection methods include benefit measurement methods and mathematical\\nmodels (also known as constrained optimization methods). Benefit measurement methods\\nmight include cost-benefit analysis and cash flow analysis.\\n11. A. The title of project coordinator indicates this is a weak matrix organization and that\\nyou are working within one of the business units rather than under the PMO (as you\\nwould if you were in a strong matrix organization). The question also states that the work\\nof the project has begun, so you are in the Executing phase of the project.\\n12. B. According to PMI, business value is defined as the net quantifiable benefit derived from\\na business endeavor. These benefits may be intangible, tangible, or both.\\n13. A, B, C. A benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of a project\\nwill be delivered. It also describes what mechanisms should be in place to measure those\\nbenefits. Examples of key elements that make up a benefits management plan include\\ntarget benefits, strategic alignment, timeframe for realizing benefits, benefits owner,\\nmetrics, assumptions, and risks. Business need is captured within a business case.\\n14. A. In a weak-matrix organization, the project coordinator has a low degree of authority,\\nwhich can be viewed as a disadvantage.\\n15. A, C, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the three types of PMOs are directive,\\nsupportive, and controlling.\\n16. A. Project A has the highest score based on the values provided. To calculate the score for\\neach project, multiply the score of each criterion against the weight of the criteria and then\\nadd up all of the scores. See the following table for the calculations:\\nCriterion Weight Project A Project A Project B Project B Project C Project C\\nScore Totals Score Totals Score Totals\\nProfit potential 5 5 25 2 10 1 5\\nMarketability 1 1 1 5 5 3 3\\nEase of use 3 2 6 3 9 5 15\\nWeighted score — — 32 — 24 — 23\\n\\n17. B. Examples of enterprise environmental factors that are used in the Identify Stakeholders\\nprocess are company culture, organizational structure, governmental or industry\\nstandards, global trends, and geographic locations of resources and facilities. The other\\noptions included are organizational process assets.\\n18. A. Market research can be used to examine industry and seller capabilities. Information\\ncan be obtained in places such as conferences, online reviews, and other sources available\\nin the market.\\n19. B. Teams working in a weak matrix organization tend to experience the least amount of\\nstress during the Closing processes. This is because, in a weak matrix organization, the\\nfunctional manager assigns all tasks (project-related tasks as well) so the team members\\nhave a job to return to once the project is completed and there’s no change in reporting\\nstructure.\\n20. B, C, D. When considering Agile approaches, organizational leaders should evaluate the\\ncompatibility of those methods to determine whether the organization is ready and can\\nsupport such change. This includes the willingness to change at the executive management\\nlevel and at the broader organizational level. There must be a willingness to focus on\\nshort-term budgeting and metrics versus long-term goals.\\n21. C. Sue is describing organizational project management (OPM). The PMBOK® Guide\\ndefines OPM as a framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are\\nintegrated with organizational enablers to achieve strategic objectives.\\n22. B. Enterprise environmental factors are the factors both internal and external to the\\norganization that can influence the project. Marketplace conditions is one example, as are\\norganizational culture, structure, and governance. Enterprise environmental factors is a\\nfrequent input of the project management processes.\\n23. D. Portfolio management groups projects, programs, portfolios, and other work that\\nis similar in scope and weighs the value of each project against the business’s strategic\\nobjectives. Portfolio management also monitors projects to make certain they adhere\\nto the objectives and make efficient use of resources. Portfolio management is usually\\nhandled by a senior manager with many years of experience in project and program\\nmanagement.\\n24. D. Benefit-cost ratio can be referred to as cost-benefit analysis. It is a common benefit\\nmeasurement method that compares the cost to produce the product, service, or result of\\nthe project to the benefit that the organization will receive after executing the project.\\n25. D. Projects are temporary endeavors undertaken to produce a unique product, service,\\nor result. Operations, on the other hand, are ongoing and repetitive and do not have an\\nending date.\\n26. A. Payback period is considered to be the least precise project selection method.\\n27. C. Because Reasons to Lyv is attempting to exploit new GPS technology that is available,\\nthe project is a result of technological advance.\\n28. D. This project came about as a result of social need. Social need is one of seven typical\\nreasons that trigger the need for a project, as noted by the PMBOK® Guide.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 267\\n29. B. Honesty can include a lot of topics: reporting the truth regarding project status, being\\nhonest about your own experience, not deceiving others, not making false statements, and so\\non. As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in your\\npossession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public when required.\\n30. A. Responsibility is the act of making decisions that are for the good of the organization\\nrather than yourself, admitting your mistakes, being responsible for the decisions you make\\n(or those you don’t make), and the consequences that result, along with other actions.\\n31. B. A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities\\nmanaged in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available when managing them\\nindividually. The other options provide the definition of a project, progressive elaboration,\\nand product life cycle.\\n32. B. Projects exist to create a unique product, service, or result. What the director in the\\nscenario describes is shifting the backend of an existing app to technology that also\\nalready exists within the company. This would reflect operations, which are considered to\\nbe ongoing and repetitive, versus the creation of new capabilities.\\n33. A. Economic models are an example of a benefit measurement method, not a constrained\\noptimization method. These are project selection techniques that can be used to measure\\nthe advantages or merits of the product of the project.\\n34. A. Although the lessons learned register is a tempting choice and is an artifact of the\\nproject, the correct answer is organizational process assets. Organizational process assets\\nare the organization’s policies, guidelines, processes, procedures, plans, approaches, and\\nstandards for conducting work, including project work. They are a frequent input to the\\nproject management processes.\\n35. C. Honesty involves not only information regarding your own background and experience\\nbut information regarding the project circumstances as well.\\n36. C. Answer C is stated backwards. IRR is the discount rate when NPV equals zero.\\n37. A. Hybrid organizations are a combination of various organizational types and typically\\ninvolve a project-oriented structure coexisting within a functional organization.\\n38. A. A megaproject is defined as a large multiyear project that costs more than $1 billion\\nand affects 1 million or more people.\\n39. B. Projects with NPV greater than 0 should be recommended; the key determining factor\\nin selecting Project Fun is that the NPV is positive. Had both NPVs been positive, then the\\ndetermining factor would have been the greater NPV number, since the scenario notes that\\nfunding exists for only one project. Payback period is considered the least precise selection\\nmethod and is not typically the sole determining factor.\\n40. A. A positive value for NPV means the project will earn a return at least equal to or\\ngreater than the cost of capital. Since NPV for Alternative A is positive, this alternative\\nwill earn at least a 12 percent return.\\n41. B. This is a false statement. Projects using an Adaptive approach prioritize work based on\\nthe highest business value items first. This reduces the failure of premature closure due to\\nsunk costs because early benefits realization occurs.\\n\\n42. C. The requirements traceability matrix links the requirements to the business and project\\nobjectives. This ensures that requirements add business value.\\n43. B. As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in\\nyour possession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public when\\nrequired. Always be up front regarding the project’s progress.\\n44. C. Organizational structures are the forms that an organization can take and their\\ninfluence on projects. They describe the style, culture, and way of communicating that\\ninfluence how project work is performed.\\n45. A. Within a project-oriented organization, the project manager has a high degree of\\nauthority, and projects are treated with priority. A project manager has high to almost\\ntotal resource access/availability, since team members are often dedicated to the project.\\n46. B. The question describes a hybrid organizational type, likely a mixture of a weak and a\\nstrong matrix. A clue is that your title is project manager, which does not typically exist\\nin a purely functional organization; another is that the functional manager manages the\\nproject budget, which is not typical in a project-oriented or PMO organizational type.\\n47. A, B, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, projects are initiated by business leaders\\nbecause of the following categories or factors: regulatory compliance, legal requirements,\\nor social requirements; stakeholder needs and requests; changing technology needs of the\\norganization; create or improve processes, services, or products.\\n48. B. The formula for present value is PV = FV / (1 + i)n. Plugging in the information from\\nthe question, the formula becomes $8,000 / (1 + .07)3 = $6,530.\\n49. A. This came about because of a business need. Staff members were spending unproductive\\nhours converting information, causing the company loss. The time the employees spent\\nconverting the information could have been spent doing something more productive.\\n50. D. The Project Management Institute is the industry-recognized standard for project\\nmanagement practices. PMI is active and recognized around the globe, although it is\\nheadquartered within the United States.\\n51. D. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is published by PMI, and all PMP\\ncredential holders are expected to adhere to its standards.\\n52. B. When resources are cut off from the project and the project is starved prior to\\ncompleting all requirements, it often leads to an unfinished project. Resources in this case\\ncan be money (such as in Yasmin’s case), human resources, equipment, or supplies. This\\ntype of project ending is referred to as starvation.\\n53. C. An organization breakdown structure is a form of organization chart that shows\\nthe departments, work units, or teams within an organization and their respective work\\npackages.\\n54. A. In a weak matrix organization, the functional manager has greater authority than the\\nproject manager. Based only on the information provided within the question, it is likely\\nthat resources will be reassigned to another project.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 269\\n55. A, D. According to Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide, published by\\nPMI, there are three recommendations to consider when applying organizational change\\nmanagement at a comprehensive level: 1) models for describing change dynamics, 2)\\nframework for achieving change, and 3) application of change management practices at\\nthe project, program, and portfolio levels.\\n56. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, project benefits are defined as outcomes of actions,\\nbehaviors, products, services, or results that provide value to the sponsoring organization\\nas well as to the project’s intended beneficiaries.\\n57. B. Tailoring refers to determining which project management processes to use when\\nmanaging and conducting the project.\\n58. A. While PMOs may facilitate the selection of projects that support a company’s strategic\\nobjectives, they are not typically responsible for establishing the objectives and selecting\\nprojects. All other options describe the types of support that a PMO typically offers\\nwithin an organization.\\n59. C. Antwon is performing portfolio management activities. Portfolio management is\\ndefined as the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic\\nobjectives; it involves guiding the investment decisions of the organization to meet the\\norganization’s strategic goals.\\n60. C. Progressive elaboration is not necessarily a deferral in planning; it refers to\\nprogressively determining the characteristics of the product, service, or result\\nincrementally, as more detail becomes available.\\n61. D. In a functional organization, the role of project manager typically does not exist.\\nInstead, it may be a part-time role or a similar role such as a project coordinator.\\n62. B. The change control board (CCB) is responsible for reviewing all change requests and\\napproving them or denying them. It is sometimes also known as a technical assessment\\nboard, technical review board, or engineering review board.\\n63. B. In this instance, Joe is correct. When resources are cut off from the project or are\\nno longer provided to the project, it’s starved prior to completing all requirements.\\nIntegration, on the other hand, is when resources of the project are distributed to other\\nareas in the organization or are assigned to other projects.\\n64. C. Weak matrix organizational structures tend to experience the least amount of stress\\nduring the project closeout processes.\\n65. A. The business case is a feasibility study that lists objectives and reasons for a project.\\nIt identifies critical success factors for the project, why the project was undertaken, an\\nanalysis of the situation, and recommendations.\\n66. C. The product owner is responsible for guiding the vision and direction of the product.\\nThis includes owning the product backlog and prioritizing the work reflected in the\\nbacklog based on its business value.\\n\\n67. B. Project selection methods are used prior to the Develop Project Charter process to\\nchoose which projects the organization should undertake or to choose among alternative\\nways of doing a project. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the project manager is not\\ninvolved in project selection.\\n68. A. The new series is unique and hasn’t been done before. There is a definite end date—\\nsweeps week in November—and the beginning date was the start of the project creation.\\nAfter the series has started, the project itself is over, and the series becomes an ongoing\\noperation.\\n69. C. Directive PMOs tend to have a high degree of control over projects, with project\\nmanagers assigned by and directly reporting to the PMO. The PMO typically controls and\\nmanages projects directly.\\n70. C. The best answer in this situation is to get the facts before taking any action. A\\nviolation based only on suspicion should not be reported. You can get the facts by telling\\nyour friend you’re concerned about the appearance of impropriety and ask her whether the\\nvendor gave her these items. It could be that these are the first of several samples that will\\nbe coming from all the vendors bidding on the project so the equipment can be evaluated\\nin light of the project objectives. Or she could have accepted them as gifts, which is not\\nappropriate. Never jump to conclusions. Always ask and get the facts straight before\\nreporting a conflict-of-interest situation.\\n71. A. Addition is a project ending where a project evolves into ongoing operations. In these\\ncases, a full-time staff can be required to support ongoing operations, maintenance, and\\nmonitoring of a project’s deliverable.\\n72. B. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct addresses core values that project\\nmanagement practitioners should and must uphold. Specifically, it applies to all PMI\\nmembers, PMI volunteers, those certified through PMI, and those going through the PMI\\ncertification process.\\n73. A. Preparing stories for the next iteration refers to backlog refinement or backlog\\ngrooming. The intent is to refine stories sufficiently so that the team understands what\\nwork must be accomplished.\\n74. A-2, B-3, C-1. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are three types of PMOs:\\nsupportive, controlling, and directive. Supportive PMOs have a low degree of control,\\ncontrolling PMOs have a moderate degree of control, and directive PMOs have a high\\ndegree of control.\\n75. D. Phase gates serve as important checkpoints throughout a project’s life that allow the\\nproject team to compare the project’s performance against the plan and decide whether\\nthe project should proceed to the next phase. The primary purpose of phase gates is not\\nintended as an audit function against regulatory compliance.\\n76. C. The benefits management plan outlines the target benefits of the project and is used\\nto measure both the tangible and intangible benefits. As part of project integration\\nmanagement activities, project managers should report progress against this plan to\\nproject stakeholders.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 271\\n77. D. The benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of the project will\\nbe delivered. It captures the target benefits, strategic alignment, timeframe for realizing\\nbenefits, and the metrics of how the benefits will be measured, along with other key\\ninformation relating to business value delivered.\\n78. B. The project is being driven by legal requirements. New projects can occur as a result of\\nlaws passed, as in the case seen in this scenario.\\n79. C. The change control board is officially chartered and given the authority to approve or\\ndeny change requests as defined by the organization and as outlined within the project\\nmanagement plan. The authority level (including exception or emergency process) should\\nbe detailed within the project management plan.\\n80. A. Part of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct requires that you cooperate in\\nany investigation concerning ethics violations and in collecting information related to the\\nviolation.\\n81. B. In a project-oriented organization, the project team is dedicated to the project. When a\\nproject is complete, they either transition to another project or are released.\\n82. E. According to the Agile Practice Guide, stakeholders should be educated on why and\\nhow to be Agile. This includes understanding the benefits of business value based on\\nprioritization, greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams, and improved\\nquality.\\n83. D. While most (if not all!) project managers hope that all project team members are\\nheld accountable to the core values identified within the Code of Ethics and Professional\\nConduct, it is written with project management practitioners in mind. This includes the\\nfollowing individuals: all PMI members, those who hold a PMI certification, those who\\nbegin the PMI certification process, and those who volunteer through PMI.\\n84. A. Responsibility entails ensuring integrity, accepting assignments we are qualified for,\\nabiding by laws and regulations, and maintaining confidential information.\\n85. B. An organization’s culture heavily influences the type of project management\\napproaches adopted by project teams and how Agile approaches are used. For example,\\nstartup environments tend to operate in a lean fashion, opting to fail fast and iterate to\\nproduce results quickly.\\n86. D. Planned value in this scenario refers to the project’s benefits. The benefits management\\nplan describes how and when the project’s benefits will be delivered. According to the\\nPMBOK® Guide, benefits are an outcome of actions, behaviors, products, services,\\nor results that provide value to the sponsoring organization as well as to the project’s\\nintended beneficiaries.\\n87. B. A controlling PMO is focused on two key areas: providing the organization with\\nsupport in its application of project management practices and requiring compliance\\nagainst those practices.\\n\\n88. D. Project managers must remain alert to changes occurring across the internal and\\nexternal business landscape to understand the impact to their projects. When this occurs,\\nsuch as in Kaylee’s case, project managers should assess and prioritize the impacts of these\\nchanges on their project and then adjust the backlog accordingly.\\n89. D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, backlog refinement is defined as the progressive\\nelaboration of project requirements and/or the ongoing activity in which the team\\ncollaboratively reviews, updates, and writes requirements to satisfy the need of the\\ncustomer request.\\n90. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, phase reviews are also called phase gates,\\nphase entrances, phase exits, stage gates, and kill points. Phase reviews typically serve as\\ncheckpoints at the end of a phase where performance or progress is evaluated against the\\nproject charter or plan. Once completed, the project progresses to the next phase.\\n91. B. Tailoring involves determining which project management processes to use when\\nmanaging and conducting the project.\\n92. A. Projects using an iterative and incremental approach to managing the project life cycle\\ntend to experience short feedback loops and reprioritization of the backlog. Frequent\\ndelivery and feedback allow the team to adapt and adjust to changes quickly, as well as\\nprioritize appropriately.\\n93. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, most projects fit one of seven needs and demands\\nthat result in their creation: market demand, organizational need, customer request,\\ntechnological advance, legal requirement, ecological impacts, or social need.\\n94. C. Honesty entails acting in a truthful manner in both our communications and conduct.\\nAlthough the project manager’s intentions seemed to result from positive intentions,\\nthe act of forging survey responses—even if he felt that they reflected truthful feedback\\nreceived—does not represent truthful actions.\\n95. D. Honesty can include a lot of topics: reporting the truth regarding project status, being\\nhonest about your own experience, not deceiving others, not making false statements, and\\nso on. According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, honesty is your duty to\\nunderstand the truth and act in a truthful manner, both in your communications and in\\nyour conduct.\\n96. A-1, B-2. Organizational process assets are factors that are internal to the organization,\\nsuch as internal policies, processes, templates, and lessons learned repositories; enterprise\\nenvironmental factors are external to the organization, such as laws, regulations,\\npublished standards, and marketplace conditions.\\n97. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, quality assurance, which occurs through the\\nManage Quality project management process, is most concerned with using project\\nprocesses effectively. This includes assuring stakeholders that the end result of the project\\nwill meet their needs and expectations and that quality requirements are met.\\n98. A. Brainstorming is a form of data gathering, a technique of the Develop Project Charter\\nprocess. Other examples of data gathering include focus groups and interviews.\\nChapter 4: Full-Length Practice Exam 1 273\\n99. C. The organization’s culture, structure, and governance are considered to be part of\\nenterprise environmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors are conditions or\\ncapabilities that are not under the direct control of the project team but that influence or\\nconstrain the project.\\n100. C. When joining a new organization, it is important that a project manager familiarize\\nthemselves with the organization’s culture. Understanding how the organization operates,\\nits tolerance level, and its appetite for risk, among other things, is important to tailoring\\nthe project management approach.\\nChapter 4: Full-Length Practice Exam 1\\n1. B. There are four development life cycles: predictive, iterative, incremental, and hybrid.\\nThe iterative development life cycle defines project deliverables early in the development\\nlife cycle and progressively elaborates them as the project or life cycle progresses.\\n2. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, decomposition of the total project work into work\\npackages involves the following five steps: 1) identifying and analyzing the deliverables,\\n2) structuring and organizing the WBS, 3) decomposing the WBS into lower-level\\ncomponents, 4) developing and assigning the identification codes, and 5) verifying the\\ndegree of decomposition of the deliverables.\\n3. A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2. The project manager’s level of authority varies, based on the\\norganizational structure that they work within. It is lowest in a functional type and\\nhighest in a project-oriented type. Matrixed structures tend to fall in the middle, with\\nweak matrix closest to functional, and strong matrix closest to project-oriented.\\n4. A. The scenario describes the early stages of a project, where the project has just been\\nselected and a project manager has been assigned. This occurs in the Initiating process group.\\n5. A. The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle was developed by Shewhart and later refined by Deming.\\nIt reflects the iterative, results-oriented, and interactive nature of the project process groups.\\n6. A. Requirements are the specifications of the deliverables and tell you how you know the\\ndeliverable was completed successfully.\\n7. A. The Expectancy Theory, proposed by Victor Vroom, states that the expectation of a\\npositive outcome drives motivation. In other words, people will behave in certain ways if\\nthey think there will be good rewards for doing so.\\n8. A. The question is asking for an input that can be used to address the engagement level\\nof stakeholders. The scenario involves the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process.\\nInterpersonal and team skills and decision-making are tools and techniques and therefore\\nnot the correct choices. Since the project management plan contains the stakeholder\\nengagement plan, which documents the strategy for engagement stakeholders, this is the\\nbest option. Other useful components of the project management plan also include the\\ncommunications management plan and resource management plan.'"

    "answer_text='1. B. The business case is an economic feasibility study used to understand the business need\\nfor the project and determine whether the investment is worthwhile. In short, it justifies\\nthe need for the project and contains information such as the project description, high-\\nlevel description of scope, analysis of the problem, financial analysis, and success factors.\\n2. B. Project management is defined as the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and\\ntechniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.\\n3. D. Since the marketing company where Bill works is a customer of Reasons to Lyv, the\\nproject being managed within his organization is a result of a customer request.\\n4. D. Respect, not fairness, is the value that addresses culture shock and diversity training.\\nAccepting vendor gifts is acceptable when the gift or situation complies with a company’s\\nstated policies.\\n5. D. All the options are part of the organizational process assets updates output of this\\nprocess. Feedback from stakeholders can be used on the current project as well as future\\nprojects.\\n6. D. The best answer to this question is D. This is a high-risk project, and a feasibility study\\nshould be conducted as a separate project because the outcome is unknown.\\n7. A. Don’t accept gifts that might be construed as conflicts of interest. If your organization\\ndoes not have a policy regarding vendor gifts, set limits for yourself depending on the\\nsituation, the history of gift acceptance by the organization in the past, and the complexity\\nof the project. It’s always better to decline a gift you’re unsure about than to accept it and\\nlater lose your credibility, your reputation, or your PMP status because of bad judgment.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 265\\n8. B. Marketplace conditions and financial management and accounts payable systems are\\nexamples of enterprise environmental factors versus organizational process assets. When\\nperforming the Close Project or Phase process, project or phase closure guidelines or\\nrequirements, along with the configuration management knowledge base, serve as valuable\\ninputs. The configuration management knowledge base contains versions and baselines of\\nstandards, policies, procedures, and project documents belonging to the organization.\\n9. B. Linear, multi-objective programming, and nonlinear are all examples of constrained\\noptimization methods, not benefit measurement methods. Benefit measurement methods\\ninclude benefit-cost ratio analysis, scoring models, and benefit contribution methods.\\n10. D. Project selection methods include benefit measurement methods and mathematical\\nmodels (also known as constrained optimization methods). Benefit measurement methods\\nmight include cost-benefit analysis and cash flow analysis.\\n11. A. The title of project coordinator indicates this is a weak matrix organization and that\\nyou are working within one of the business units rather than under the PMO (as you\\nwould if you were in a strong matrix organization). The question also states that the work\\nof the project has begun, so you are in the Executing phase of the project.\\n12. B. According to PMI, business value is defined as the net quantifiable benefit derived from\\na business endeavor. These benefits may be intangible, tangible, or both.\\n13. A, B, C. A benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of a project\\nwill be delivered. It also describes what mechanisms should be in place to measure those\\nbenefits. Examples of key elements that make up a benefits management plan include\\ntarget benefits, strategic alignment, timeframe for realizing benefits, benefits owner,\\nmetrics, assumptions, and risks. Business need is captured within a business case.\\n14. A. In a weak-matrix organization, the project coordinator has a low degree of authority,\\nwhich can be viewed as a disadvantage.\\n15. A, C, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the three types of PMOs are directive,\\nsupportive, and controlling.\\n16. A. Project A has the highest score based on the values provided. To calculate the score for\\neach project, multiply the score of each criterion against the weight of the criteria and then\\nadd up all of the scores. See the following table for the calculations:\\nCriterion Weight Project A Project A Project B Project B Project C Project C\\nScore Totals Score Totals Score Totals\\nProfit potential 5 5 25 2 10 1 5\\nMarketability 1 1 1 5 5 3 3\\nEase of use 3 2 6 3 9 5 15\\nWeighted score — — 32 — 24 — 23\\n\\n17. B. Examples of enterprise environmental factors that are used in the Identify Stakeholders\\nprocess are company culture, organizational structure, governmental or industry\\nstandards, global trends, and geographic locations of resources and facilities. The other\\noptions included are organizational process assets.\\n18. A. Market research can be used to examine industry and seller capabilities. Information\\ncan be obtained in places such as conferences, online reviews, and other sources available\\nin the market.\\n19. B. Teams working in a weak matrix organization tend to experience the least amount of\\nstress during the Closing processes. This is because, in a weak matrix organization, the\\nfunctional manager assigns all tasks (project-related tasks as well) so the team members\\nhave a job to return to once the project is completed and there’s no change in reporting\\nstructure.\\n20. B, C, D. When considering Agile approaches, organizational leaders should evaluate the\\ncompatibility of those methods to determine whether the organization is ready and can\\nsupport such change. This includes the willingness to change at the executive management\\nlevel and at the broader organizational level. There must be a willingness to focus on\\nshort-term budgeting and metrics versus long-term goals.\\n21. C. Sue is describing organizational project management (OPM). The PMBOK® Guide\\ndefines OPM as a framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are\\nintegrated with organizational enablers to achieve strategic objectives.\\n22. B. Enterprise environmental factors are the factors both internal and external to the\\norganization that can influence the project. Marketplace conditions is one example, as are\\norganizational culture, structure, and governance. Enterprise environmental factors is a\\nfrequent input of the project management processes.\\n23. D. Portfolio management groups projects, programs, portfolios, and other work that\\nis similar in scope and weighs the value of each project against the business’s strategic\\nobjectives. Portfolio management also monitors projects to make certain they adhere\\nto the objectives and make efficient use of resources. Portfolio management is usually\\nhandled by a senior manager with many years of experience in project and program\\nmanagement.\\n24. D. Benefit-cost ratio can be referred to as cost-benefit analysis. It is a common benefit\\nmeasurement method that compares the cost to produce the product, service, or result of\\nthe project to the benefit that the organization will receive after executing the project.\\n25. D. Projects are temporary endeavors undertaken to produce a unique product, service,\\nor result. Operations, on the other hand, are ongoing and repetitive and do not have an\\nending date.\\n26. A. Payback period is considered to be the least precise project selection method.\\n27. C. Because Reasons to Lyv is attempting to exploit new GPS technology that is available,\\nthe project is a result of technological advance.\\n28. D. This project came about as a result of social need. Social need is one of seven typical\\nreasons that trigger the need for a project, as noted by the PMBOK® Guide.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 267\\n29. B. Honesty can include a lot of topics: reporting the truth regarding project status, being\\nhonest about your own experience, not deceiving others, not making false statements, and so\\non. As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in your\\npossession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public when required.\\n30. A. Responsibility is the act of making decisions that are for the good of the organization\\nrather than yourself, admitting your mistakes, being responsible for the decisions you make\\n(or those you don’t make), and the consequences that result, along with other actions.\\n31. B. A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities\\nmanaged in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available when managing them\\nindividually. The other options provide the definition of a project, progressive elaboration,\\nand product life cycle.\\n32. B. Projects exist to create a unique product, service, or result. What the director in the\\nscenario describes is shifting the backend of an existing app to technology that also\\nalready exists within the company. This would reflect operations, which are considered to\\nbe ongoing and repetitive, versus the creation of new capabilities.\\n33. A. Economic models are an example of a benefit measurement method, not a constrained\\noptimization method. These are project selection techniques that can be used to measure\\nthe advantages or merits of the product of the project.\\n34. A. Although the lessons learned register is a tempting choice and is an artifact of the\\nproject, the correct answer is organizational process assets. Organizational process assets\\nare the organization’s policies, guidelines, processes, procedures, plans, approaches, and\\nstandards for conducting work, including project work. They are a frequent input to the\\nproject management processes.\\n35. C. Honesty involves not only information regarding your own background and experience\\nbut information regarding the project circumstances as well.\\n36. C. Answer C is stated backwards. IRR is the discount rate when NPV equals zero.\\n37. A. Hybrid organizations are a combination of various organizational types and typically\\ninvolve a project-oriented structure coexisting within a functional organization.\\n38. A. A megaproject is defined as a large multiyear project that costs more than $1 billion\\nand affects 1 million or more people.\\n39. B. Projects with NPV greater than 0 should be recommended; the key determining factor\\nin selecting Project Fun is that the NPV is positive. Had both NPVs been positive, then the\\ndetermining factor would have been the greater NPV number, since the scenario notes that\\nfunding exists for only one project. Payback period is considered the least precise selection\\nmethod and is not typically the sole determining factor.\\n40. A. A positive value for NPV means the project will earn a return at least equal to or\\ngreater than the cost of capital. Since NPV for Alternative A is positive, this alternative\\nwill earn at least a 12 percent return.\\n41. B. This is a false statement. Projects using an Adaptive approach prioritize work based on\\nthe highest business value items first. This reduces the failure of premature closure due to\\nsunk costs because early benefits realization occurs.\\n\\n42. C. The requirements traceability matrix links the requirements to the business and project\\nobjectives. This ensures that requirements add business value.\\n43. B. As a project manager, you are responsible for truthfully reporting all information in\\nyour possession to stakeholders, customers, the project sponsor, and the public when\\nrequired. Always be up front regarding the project’s progress.\\n44. C. Organizational structures are the forms that an organization can take and their\\ninfluence on projects. They describe the style, culture, and way of communicating that\\ninfluence how project work is performed.\\n45. A. Within a project-oriented organization, the project manager has a high degree of\\nauthority, and projects are treated with priority. A project manager has high to almost\\ntotal resource access/availability, since team members are often dedicated to the project.\\n46. B. The question describes a hybrid organizational type, likely a mixture of a weak and a\\nstrong matrix. A clue is that your title is project manager, which does not typically exist\\nin a purely functional organization; another is that the functional manager manages the\\nproject budget, which is not typical in a project-oriented or PMO organizational type.\\n47. A, B, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, projects are initiated by business leaders\\nbecause of the following categories or factors: regulatory compliance, legal requirements,\\nor social requirements; stakeholder needs and requests; changing technology needs of the\\norganization; create or improve processes, services, or products.\\n48. B. The formula for present value is PV = FV / (1 + i)n. Plugging in the information from\\nthe question, the formula becomes $8,000 / (1 + .07)3 = $6,530.\\n49. A. This came about because of a business need. Staff members were spending unproductive\\nhours converting information, causing the company loss. The time the employees spent\\nconverting the information could have been spent doing something more productive.\\n50. D. The Project Management Institute is the industry-recognized standard for project\\nmanagement practices. PMI is active and recognized around the globe, although it is\\nheadquartered within the United States.\\n51. D. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is published by PMI, and all PMP\\ncredential holders are expected to adhere to its standards.\\n52. B. When resources are cut off from the project and the project is starved prior to\\ncompleting all requirements, it often leads to an unfinished project. Resources in this case\\ncan be money (such as in Yasmin’s case), human resources, equipment, or supplies. This\\ntype of project ending is referred to as starvation.\\n53. C. An organization breakdown structure is a form of organization chart that shows\\nthe departments, work units, or teams within an organization and their respective work\\npackages.\\n54. A. In a weak matrix organization, the functional manager has greater authority than the\\nproject manager. Based only on the information provided within the question, it is likely\\nthat resources will be reassigned to another project.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 269\\n55. A, D. According to Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide, published by\\nPMI, there are three recommendations to consider when applying organizational change\\nmanagement at a comprehensive level: 1) models for describing change dynamics, 2)\\nframework for achieving change, and 3) application of change management practices at\\nthe project, program, and portfolio levels.\\n56. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, project benefits are defined as outcomes of actions,\\nbehaviors, products, services, or results that provide value to the sponsoring organization\\nas well as to the project’s intended beneficiaries.\\n57. B. Tailoring refers to determining which project management processes to use when\\nmanaging and conducting the project.\\n58. A. While PMOs may facilitate the selection of projects that support a company’s strategic\\nobjectives, they are not typically responsible for establishing the objectives and selecting\\nprojects. All other options describe the types of support that a PMO typically offers\\nwithin an organization.\\n59. C. Antwon is performing portfolio management activities. Portfolio management is\\ndefined as the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic\\nobjectives; it involves guiding the investment decisions of the organization to meet the\\norganization’s strategic goals.\\n60. C. Progressive elaboration is not necessarily a deferral in planning; it refers to\\nprogressively determining the characteristics of the product, service, or result\\nincrementally, as more detail becomes available.\\n61. D. In a functional organization, the role of project manager typically does not exist.\\nInstead, it may be a part-time role or a similar role such as a project coordinator.\\n62. B. The change control board (CCB) is responsible for reviewing all change requests and\\napproving them or denying them. It is sometimes also known as a technical assessment\\nboard, technical review board, or engineering review board.\\n63. B. In this instance, Joe is correct. When resources are cut off from the project or are\\nno longer provided to the project, it’s starved prior to completing all requirements.\\nIntegration, on the other hand, is when resources of the project are distributed to other\\nareas in the organization or are assigned to other projects.\\n64. C. Weak matrix organizational structures tend to experience the least amount of stress\\nduring the project closeout processes.\\n65. A. The business case is a feasibility study that lists objectives and reasons for a project.\\nIt identifies critical success factors for the project, why the project was undertaken, an\\nanalysis of the situation, and recommendations.\\n66. C. The product owner is responsible for guiding the vision and direction of the product.\\nThis includes owning the product backlog and prioritizing the work reflected in the\\nbacklog based on its business value.\\n\\n67. B. Project selection methods are used prior to the Develop Project Charter process to\\nchoose which projects the organization should undertake or to choose among alternative\\nways of doing a project. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the project manager is not\\ninvolved in project selection.\\n68. A. The new series is unique and hasn’t been done before. There is a definite end date—\\nsweeps week in November—and the beginning date was the start of the project creation.\\nAfter the series has started, the project itself is over, and the series becomes an ongoing\\noperation.\\n69. C. Directive PMOs tend to have a high degree of control over projects, with project\\nmanagers assigned by and directly reporting to the PMO. The PMO typically controls and\\nmanages projects directly.\\n70. C. The best answer in this situation is to get the facts before taking any action. A\\nviolation based only on suspicion should not be reported. You can get the facts by telling\\nyour friend you’re concerned about the appearance of impropriety and ask her whether the\\nvendor gave her these items. It could be that these are the first of several samples that will\\nbe coming from all the vendors bidding on the project so the equipment can be evaluated\\nin light of the project objectives. Or she could have accepted them as gifts, which is not\\nappropriate. Never jump to conclusions. Always ask and get the facts straight before\\nreporting a conflict-of-interest situation.\\n71. A. Addition is a project ending where a project evolves into ongoing operations. In these\\ncases, a full-time staff can be required to support ongoing operations, maintenance, and\\nmonitoring of a project’s deliverable.\\n72. B. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct addresses core values that project\\nmanagement practitioners should and must uphold. Specifically, it applies to all PMI\\nmembers, PMI volunteers, those certified through PMI, and those going through the PMI\\ncertification process.\\n73. A. Preparing stories for the next iteration refers to backlog refinement or backlog\\ngrooming. The intent is to refine stories sufficiently so that the team understands what\\nwork must be accomplished.\\n74. A-2, B-3, C-1. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are three types of PMOs:\\nsupportive, controlling, and directive. Supportive PMOs have a low degree of control,\\ncontrolling PMOs have a moderate degree of control, and directive PMOs have a high\\ndegree of control.\\n75. D. Phase gates serve as important checkpoints throughout a project’s life that allow the\\nproject team to compare the project’s performance against the plan and decide whether\\nthe project should proceed to the next phase. The primary purpose of phase gates is not\\nintended as an audit function against regulatory compliance.\\n76. C. The benefits management plan outlines the target benefits of the project and is used\\nto measure both the tangible and intangible benefits. As part of project integration\\nmanagement activities, project managers should report progress against this plan to\\nproject stakeholders.\\nChapter 3: Business Environment (Domain 3.0) 271\\n77. D. The benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of the project will\\nbe delivered. It captures the target benefits, strategic alignment, timeframe for realizing\\nbenefits, and the metrics of how the benefits will be measured, along with other key\\ninformation relating to business value delivered.\\n78. B. The project is being driven by legal requirements. New projects can occur as a result of\\nlaws passed, as in the case seen in this scenario.\\n79. C. The change control board is officially chartered and given the authority to approve or\\ndeny change requests as defined by the organization and as outlined within the project\\nmanagement plan. The authority level (including exception or emergency process) should\\nbe detailed within the project management plan.\\n80. A. Part of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct requires that you cooperate in\\nany investigation concerning ethics violations and in collecting information related to the\\nviolation.\\n81. B. In a project-oriented organization, the project team is dedicated to the project. When a\\nproject is complete, they either transition to another project or are released.\\n82. E. According to the Agile Practice Guide, stakeholders should be educated on why and\\nhow to be Agile. This includes understanding the benefits of business value based on\\nprioritization, greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams, and improved\\nquality.\\n83. D. While most (if not all!) project managers hope that all project team members are\\nheld accountable to the core values identified within the Code of Ethics and Professional\\nConduct, it is written with project management practitioners in mind. This includes the\\nfollowing individuals: all PMI members, those who hold a PMI certification, those who\\nbegin the PMI certification process, and those who volunteer through PMI.\\n84. A. Responsibility entails ensuring integrity, accepting assignments we are qualified for,\\nabiding by laws and regulations, and maintaining confidential information.\\n85. B. An organization’s culture heavily influences the type of project management\\napproaches adopted by project teams and how Agile approaches are used. For example,\\nstartup environments tend to operate in a lean fashion, opting to fail fast and iterate to\\nproduce results quickly.\\n86. D. Planned value in this scenario refers to the project’s benefits. The benefits management\\nplan describes how and when the project’s benefits will be delivered. According to the\\nPMBOK® Guide, benefits are an outcome of actions, behaviors, products, services,\\nor results that provide value to the sponsoring organization as well as to the project’s\\nintended beneficiaries.\\n87. B. A controlling PMO is focused on two key areas: providing the organization with\\nsupport in its application of project management practices and requiring compliance\\nagainst those practices.\\n\\n88. D. Project managers must remain alert to changes occurring across the internal and\\nexternal business landscape to understand the impact to their projects. When this occurs,\\nsuch as in Kaylee’s case, project managers should assess and prioritize the impacts of these\\nchanges on their project and then adjust the backlog accordingly.\\n89. D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, backlog refinement is defined as the progressive\\nelaboration of project requirements and/or the ongoing activity in which the team\\ncollaboratively reviews, updates, and writes requirements to satisfy the need of the\\ncustomer request.\\n90. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, phase reviews are also called phase gates,\\nphase entrances, phase exits, stage gates, and kill points. Phase reviews typically serve as\\ncheckpoints at the end of a phase where performance or progress is evaluated against the\\nproject charter or plan. Once completed, the project progresses to the next phase.\\n91. B. Tailoring involves determining which project management processes to use when\\nmanaging and conducting the project.\\n92. A. Projects using an iterative and incremental approach to managing the project life cycle\\ntend to experience short feedback loops and reprioritization of the backlog. Frequent\\ndelivery and feedback allow the team to adapt and adjust to changes quickly, as well as\\nprioritize appropriately.\\n93. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, most projects fit one of seven needs and demands\\nthat result in their creation: market demand, organizational need, customer request,\\ntechnological advance, legal requirement, ecological impacts, or social need.\\n94. C. Honesty entails acting in a truthful manner in both our communications and conduct.\\nAlthough the project manager’s intentions seemed to result from positive intentions,\\nthe act of forging survey responses—even if he felt that they reflected truthful feedback\\nreceived—does not represent truthful actions.\\n95. D. Honesty can include a lot of topics: reporting the truth regarding project status, being\\nhonest about your own experience, not deceiving others, not making false statements, and\\nso on. According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, honesty is your duty to\\nunderstand the truth and act in a truthful manner, both in your communications and in\\nyour conduct.\\n96. A-1, B-2. Organizational process assets are factors that are internal to the organization,\\nsuch as internal policies, processes, templates, and lessons learned repositories; enterprise\\nenvironmental factors are external to the organization, such as laws, regulations,\\npublished standards, and marketplace conditions.\\n97. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, quality assurance, which occurs through the\\nManage Quality project management process, is most concerned with using project\\nprocesses effectively. This includes assuring stakeholders that the end result of the project\\nwill meet their needs and expectations and that quality requirements are met.\\n98. A. Brainstorming is a form of data gathering, a technique of the Develop Project Charter\\nprocess. Other examples of data gathering include focus groups and interviews.\\nChapter 4: Full-Length Practice Exam 1 273\\n99. C. The organization’s culture, structure, and governance are considered to be part of\\nenterprise environmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors are conditions or\\ncapabilities that are not under the direct control of the project team but that influence or\\nconstrain the project.\\n100. C. When joining a new organization, it is important that a project manager familiarize\\nthemselves with the organization’s culture. Understanding how the organization operates,\\nits tolerance level, and its appetite for risk, among other things, is important to tailoring\\nthe project management approach.'"

    "answer_text='1. B. There are four development life cycles: predictive, iterative, incremental, and hybrid.\\nThe iterative development life cycle defines project deliverables early in the development\\nlife cycle and progressively elaborates them as the project or life cycle progresses.\\n2. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, decomposition of the total project work into work\\npackages involves the following five steps: 1) identifying and analyzing the deliverables,\\n2) structuring and organizing the WBS, 3) decomposing the WBS into lower-level\\ncomponents, 4) developing and assigning the identification codes, and 5) verifying the\\ndegree of decomposition of the deliverables.\\n3. A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2. The project manager’s level of authority varies, based on the\\norganizational structure that they work within. It is lowest in a functional type and\\nhighest in a project-oriented type. Matrixed structures tend to fall in the middle, with\\nweak matrix closest to functional, and strong matrix closest to project-oriented.\\n4. A. The scenario describes the early stages of a project, where the project has just been\\nselected and a project manager has been assigned. This occurs in the Initiating process group.\\n5. A. The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle was developed by Shewhart and later refined by Deming.\\nIt reflects the iterative, results-oriented, and interactive nature of the project process groups.\\n6. A. Requirements are the specifications of the deliverables and tell you how you know the\\ndeliverable was completed successfully.\\n7. A. The Expectancy Theory, proposed by Victor Vroom, states that the expectation of a\\npositive outcome drives motivation. In other words, people will behave in certain ways if\\nthey think there will be good rewards for doing so.\\n8. A. The question is asking for an input that can be used to address the engagement level\\nof stakeholders. The scenario involves the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process.\\nInterpersonal and team skills and decision-making are tools and techniques and therefore\\nnot the correct choices. Since the project management plan contains the stakeholder\\nengagement plan, which documents the strategy for engagement stakeholders, this is the\\nbest option. Other useful components of the project management plan also include the\\ncommunications management plan and resource management plan.\\n274 \\n9. D. Albert is attempting to manage the project using a predictive approach, which aims\\nto identify the majority of requirements early on in the project’s life cycle. A technology\\nstartup environment, coupled with a high-uncertainty project, is likely to lean toward an\\nadaptive approach to managing projects.\\n10. C. The product manager is using an incremental approach to carry out the project. This\\nmethod generates incremental value to the customer through its frequent delivery cadence,\\nshort and frequent feedback loops, and ability to reprioritize and adapt based on changing\\nor clarified requirements.\\n11. B. The project manager is currently performing the Direct and Manage Project Work\\nprocess. Of the options provided, project management information system (PMIS) is the\\nonly tool or technique listed. The change log and approved change requests are inputs to\\nthe process, while work performance data is an output.\\n12. D. A project manager or other stakeholders may use various types of power to get work\\ndone. Punishment, expert, legitimate, and referent are all types of power.\\n13. B. It is important to monitor ongoing changes to the external business environment that\\nmay impact current or future projects. This is an element of enterprise environmental\\nfactors, a key input to many project management activities.\\n14. D. To calculate variance at completion, subtract the estimate at completion from the\\nbudget at completion (BAC – EAC): $550,000 – $525,000 = $25,000.\\n15. B. The cost plus fixed fee contract reimburses the seller for the allowable costs and\\nincludes a fixed fee for completing the project as outlined in the terms of the contract.\\n16. C. Both senders and receivers transmit information they receive through their knowledge\\nof the subject, cultural influences, language, emotions, attitudes, and geographic locations.\\nSenders should keep this in mind when preparing their messages. Senders are responsible\\nfor communicating the information clearly and concisely, and receivers are responsible for\\nunderstanding the information correctly.\\n17. C. Payback period is the least precise of all cash flow calculations, so you shouldn’t give\\nthis a lot of consideration if NPV is positive and IRR is greater than 0. Since Project B and\\nProject D both have a negative NPV, they shouldn’t be chosen. Project C has a higher IRR\\nvalue than Project A and should be the project you choose, even though its payback period\\nis longer than that of Project A.\\n18. D. Agile teams tend to place greater importance on delivering business value often. For\\nthis reason, emphasis is placed on frequent feedback, frequent delivery, and remaining\\nadaptable to changing or evolving requirements.\\n19. B. The greatest expense for most projects is resources, both human and material and\\nsupplies.\\n20. D. Analogous estimating is also referred to as top-down estimating. This technique uses\\nthe actual duration of a similar activity completed on a previous project to determine the\\nduration of a current activity.\\n21. C. The project charter not only authorizes the existence of a project but also provides\\nthe project manager with authority to begin applying organizational resources to project\\nactivities.\\n22. D. Quality reports, an output of the Manage Quality process, typically include quality\\nmanagement issues escalated; recommendations for process, project, and product\\nimprovements; corrective actions recommendations; and summary of quality control\\nfindings.\\n23. D. The project manager is in the process of carrying out the Identify Stakeholders\\nprocess. The stakeholder register, the primary output, captures the list of stakeholders and\\ndocuments information about them, including any assessment information.\\n24. D. During the Planning phase of the project life cycle, stakeholder influence tends to be\\nhigh, although it is highest during Initiating; costs, staffing, and chances for successful\\nproject completion tend to be low during Planning.\\n25. A. IRR is the discount rate when the present value of the cash inflows equals the original\\ninvestment. Project C’s original investment equals the present value of its cash inflows at a\\ndiscount rate of 7 percent. Therefore, Project A has the highest IRR and should be chosen\\nabove the other two.\\n26. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, a project manager is likely to leverage the following\\ntools and techniques to manage stakeholder engagement: expert judgment, communication\\nskills (feedback), interpersonal and team skills (conflict management, cultural awareness,\\nnegotiation, observation/conversation, political awareness), ground rules, and meetings.\\nDecision-making, while valuable, is a tool and technique used to monitor stakeholder\\nengagement.\\n27. B, C, D. The Agile Manifesto for Software Development was published in 2001 by\\nthought leaders in the software industry. The intent was to propose a new way of\\ndeveloping software. It consists of 12 principles and 4 key values.\\n28. B. Work performance information includes information regarding the status of risks (in\\nthe case of the Monitor Risks process), the status of change requests, and more. Work\\nperformance data and work performance reports are both inputs to this process.\\n29. C, D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, the goal of project management is to\\nproduce business value. The method that a team uses to deliver value should be based on\\nwhich would yield the most successful outcome. This is often driven by the nature of the\\nproject and the circumstances surrounding the project.\\n30. B. Data analysis is a tool and technique used within the Perform Integrated Change\\nControl process, where change requests are evaluated by the change control board. As\\npart of performing data analysis, alternatives are considered, and a cost-benefit analysis is\\nperformed to determine whether the changes proposed are worth the associated costs.\\n31. B. Approved change requests are an output of the Perform Integrated Change Control\\nprocess but not of the Monitor Risks process.\\n276 \\n32. D. This question describes the Direct and Manage Project Work process. Approved\\nchanges are one of the inputs of this process. The daydream involves a conflict-of-interest\\nsituation. Thank goodness it was only a dream.\\n33. A. The question describes two different levels of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: social\\nneeds and self-esteem needs.\\n34. A. The project manager has performed the Define Activities, Sequence Activities, and\\nEstimate Activity Resources processes. Next, she is likely to perform the Estimate Activity\\nDurations process to determine how long each activity will take.\\n35. B. The solicitation stage is where vendors respond to the RFP.\\n36. A, B, C. The Agile Manifesto for Software Development was published in 2001 by\\nthought leaders in the software industry. The intent was to propose a new way of\\ndeveloping software. It consists of 12 principles and 4 key values.\\n37. B. Information management systems are ways of distributing project information to the\\nteam. Electronic files are a method to store files and are not a distribution method.\\n38. C. You are performing the Determine Budget process. The purpose of this process is to\\naggregate the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to establish an\\nauthorized cost baseline.\\n39. C. The collective phases a project progresses through are known as the project life cycle.\\n40. B. The minimum viable product reflects the minimum number of features intended to roll\\nout a product to a limited number of customers. In some cases, the MVP is a prototype\\nthat can yield feedback that will be incorporated into the finished product.\\n41. A, B, C. The most effective Agile teams tend to range from three to nine team members in\\nsize, are colocated, and are able to dedicate 100 percent of their time to the team and work\\nat hand. Agile teams typically have daily stand-up meetings versus daily status meetings.\\n42. A. Claims administration is a tool and technique of the Control Procurements process.\\nThis involves documenting, monitoring, and managing contested changes to the contract.\\nSpecifically, the project manager in this scenario is using arbitration, which involves\\nbringing all parties to the table with a third, disinterested party who is not a participant in\\nthe contract to try to reach an agreement.\\n43. C. The project manager will need to analyze the impact of the scope change and what\\noptions exist, such as whether to undo what has been completed, or analyze whether the\\nscope change should be approved. This should occur through the formal change control\\nprocess via a change request.\\n44. D. The project charter identifies the purpose of the project and the project or product\\ndescription. It includes a summary budget and summary milestone schedule. A detailed\\nproject schedule is not part of the project charter.\\n45. C. According to the PMBOK® Guide, project teams spend effort in identifying and\\nanalyzing risks and developing risk responses but then take no action in managing the risk.\\n46. B. The question describes the Monitor Communications process. This process involves\\nensuring the information needs of the project and its stakeholders are met; the project\\nmanager determines whether the communications planned are achieving the desired\\nresults.\\n47. D. A team using a flow-based agile approach, such as Kanban, focuses on developing\\nprioritized features from the backlog. As capacity opens, the team pulls the next feature\\nfrom the backlog and shifts it to the next column of the task board. They work on the\\nfeature until it is complete and then move on to the next one.\\n48. C. Rianna is currently performing the Manage Team process. This process is concerned\\nwith tracking team member performance, providing feedback, resolving issues, and\\nmanaging team changes to optimize project performance.\\n49. B. The changes to the project management plan (and subsidiary plans within it) are\\ndispositioned and managed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.\\n50. B. Stakeholders have the greatest chance of influence over the project and the\\ncharacteristics of the product, service, or results of the project in the early phases of the\\nproject, not the end. All other statements are true.\\n51. A. The project manager and team are likely to execute the work associated with the\\napproved change requests. These approved change requests are implemented through the\\nDirect and Manage Project Work process.\\n52. C. Roshoud and Sally are performing the Plan Resource Management process, where\\nroles and responsibilities are identified and documented, which is a process that belongs to\\nthe Project Resource Management Knowledge Area.\\n53. A. The scenario describes the early stages of a project, which has just been selected and a\\nproject manager assigned. This occurs in the Initiating process group.\\n54. A. This is the estimate to complete (ETC) calculation, which will estimate the remaining\\nwork of the project. The ETC calculation is part of the forecasting tool and technique of\\nthe Control Costs process.\\n55. C. As uncertainty in projects increases, the likelihood of change also increases. Depending\\non the project management approach used, wasted work and the need for rework may also\\nincrease.\\n56. C. A master service agreement allows the project manager and procurement team\\nto create a multitiered structure when formalizing a contracting relationship. This is\\nespecially useful for hybrid project approaches, where some items will be fixed (i.e.,\\nwarranties) and others will be more dynamic.\\n57. D. The project manager and project team together are responsible for determining how\\nbest to tailor the project management processes, based on the needs of the project.\\n58. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, assumptions are factors in the planning process\\nconsidered to be true, real, or certain, without proof or demonstration. They are factors\\nexpected to be in place or to be in evidence.\\n278 \\n59. B. Kaylee has just carried out the Collect Requirements process and is likely to carry out\\nthe Define Scope process next.\\n60. A. The Initiating processes are characterized by low costs, low staffing levels, decreased\\nchances for a successful completion, high risk, and the greatest amount of stakeholder\\ninfluence concerning the characteristics of the product or service of the project. Initiating\\nacknowledges that the project or next phase of the project should begin and authorizes the\\nassignment of resources.\\n61. A-4, B-1, C-5, D-2, E-3. Measuring ongoing progress against committed work is\\nimportant for predictive, adaptive, and hybrid project delivery approaches. There are\\nvarious methods of measuring and displaying progress.\\n62. D. Purchase order, memorandum of understanding, and agreement are all terms used for\\na contract according to the PMBOK® Guide. A procurement order is different.\\n63. C. Douglas McGregor defined two models of worker behavior, Theory X and Theory Y,\\nthat attempt to explain how different managers deal with their team members. Theory X\\nmanagers believe most people do not like work and will try to steer clear of it; they believe\\npeople have little to no ambition, need constant supervision, and won’t actually perform\\nthe duties of their job unless threatened.\\n64. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, work performance data refers to the raw\\nobservations and measurements identified during activities being performed to carry out\\nthe project work. This occurs as a result of processes belonging to the Executing process\\ngroup.\\n65. B. Change requests may take the form of preventive or corrective actions or workarounds.\\nIt’s not too late to take preventive action in the Monitoring and Controlling process\\ngroup.\\n66. A-2, B-3, C-1. There are a variety of project management office (PMO) types. The\\nPMBOK® Guide provides an example of three distinct types: supportive, controlling, and\\ndirective.\\n67. D. The project manager is in the process of carrying out stakeholder analysis and is\\nevaluating the level of interest and influence of stakeholders. In this scenario, the project\\nmanager is carrying out the Identify Stakeholders process.\\n68. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, phase reviews are also called phase gates,\\nphase entrances, phase exits, stage gates, and kill points. Phase reviews typically serve as\\ncheckpoints at the end of a phase where performance or progress is evaluated against the\\nproject charter or plan. Once completed, the project progresses to the next phase.\\n69. D. The purpose of the Monitor Risks process is to monitor risk response plans, track\\nidentified risks, identify and analyze new risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of the\\nrisk processes. As part of carrying out this process, risk review meetings may be held to\\nexamine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project\\nrisks and individual project risks.\\n70. B. Manage Communications is concerned with ensuring the timely and appropriate\\ncollection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and\\nultimate disposition of project information. In this scenario, the project manager is\\nutilizing communication skills.\\n71. D. Deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must\\nbe produced before the project or project phase is considered complete. Requirements\\nare the specifications of the deliverables and tell you how you know the deliverables were\\ncompleted successfully.\\n72. C. The Acquire Resources process is concerned with all resources for the project, both\\nexisting staff members and consultants or external staff. The procurement processes are\\nused to obtain the staff members, and the Acquire Resources process involves attaining\\nand assigning resources.\\n73. C. The project will recoup its investment by month 18. To calculate, simply total the cash\\ninflow for every quarter as indicated; payback is reached when you hit the amount of total\\ninvestment.\\n74. A. Robert is correct in stating that project managers should consider all project\\nmanagement processes as they are managing projects. This does not mean that all project\\nmanagement processes must be carried out, but they must be evaluated and considered for\\ntheir applicability.\\n75. B. This question describes the characteristics of an effective team.\\n76. D. The procurement documentation contains a variety of useful information relating\\nto the agreement signed with a vendor, including the statement of work, payment\\ninformation, performance information, and any other correspondence with the vendor.\\nWhile the project management plan and agreement are two other key inputs, they alone\\ndo not provide sufficient information for the meeting with Nicolas. This type of discussion\\nand analysis occurs as part of performing the Control Procurements process, and\\nprocurement documentation is a key input of the process.\\n77. B. Sally failed to keep Roshoud, as the project sponsor, informed and up to date. The\\nscenario notes that he heard of the resource gaps and had to approach Sally to get\\nclarification.\\n78. C. The elements of communication involve senders, receivers, and messages. The\\ncommunication model, a tool and technique of the Manage Communications process,\\nincludes encoding, decoding, acknowledging, and feedback/response. Verbal and written\\nare forms of communication.\\n79. A. The project manager is in the process of carrying out the Identify Stakeholders process.\\nAs part of this process, stakeholder analysis is performed. Stakeholder analysis and\\nidentification should occur regularly throughout the project’s life cycle.\\n80. C. The configuration management system, used in the Perform Integrated Change Control\\nprocess, documents the physical characteristics of the product of the project and ensures\\nthat the description is accurate and complete.\\n280 \\n81. B. This is describing a weighting system technique. Vendor B had a final score of 37, and\\nvendor A had a final score of 26. For each vendor, multiply each score by its weight, and\\nadd the results to obtain that vendor’s final score.\\n82. B. While the project management plan is technically a correct answer, the question\\nspecifically refers to the resource management plan (a component of the project\\nmanagement plan).\\n83. B. Plan Stakeholder Engagement is concerned with effectively engaging stakeholders,\\nunderstanding their needs and interests, understanding the good and bad things they bring\\nto the project, and understanding how the project will affect them.\\n84. B. The performance measurement baseline consists of the schedule, scope, and cost\\nbaseline. The cost baseline does not include management reserves; therefore, the PMB\\ndoes not include them.\\n85. C. Plan Schedule Management, Estimate Activity Durations, and Control Schedule\\nare processes that belong to the Project Schedule Management Knowledge Area. Other\\nprocesses belonging to this Knowledge Area include Define Activities, Sequence Activities,\\nand Develop Schedule.\\n86. B. Alyssa is carrying out the Plan Scope Management process and is using the expert\\njudgment technique to help produce the scope management plan.\\n87. D. NPV and IRR will generally bring you to the same accept/reject decision.\\n88. D. Fast-tracking is the best answer in this scenario. Budget was the original constraint on\\nthis project, so it’s highly unlikely the project manager would get more resources to assist\\nwith the project. The next best thing is to compress phases to shorten the project duration.\\n89. B. The scenario describes activities associated with the Acquire Resources and Conduct\\nProcurements processes, which are processes that belong to the Executing process group.\\n90. B. You are in the Manage Quality process and have performed a quality audit. Quality\\naudits are performed to determine inefficient or ineffective processes, policies, procedures,\\nand guidelines, and, when performed correctly, to determine if the product is fit for use, if\\napplicable laws and standards are followed, if corrective actions are necessary, and more.\\n91. A, B, C, E. A RACI is a type of responsibility assignment matrix that captures resources\\nassigned and how they are associated with the work of the project. RACI stands for\\nresponsible, accountable, consult, inform.\\n92. A. You have just performed a quality audit and identified a need for a corrective action.\\n93. C. The Manage Project Knowledge process, like most processes, is performed iteratively\\nthroughout the project’s life cycle.\\n94. A. This Knowledge Area is responsible for both human and physical resources.\\n95. B. The Tuckman ladder, developed by Dr. Bruce Tuckman, is a team development model\\nthat identifies the various stages of development that a team goes through together.\\n96. A. Enterprise environmental factors are both internal and external factors that can\\ninfluence or impact a project. In the Acquire Resources process, enterprise environmental\\nfactors is a key input that represents existing information on organizational resources,\\nsuch as availability, experience levels, interests, costs, and competence levels.\\n97. A. Cost-reimbursable contracts go by various names, depending on certain terms used.\\nThey include cost plus incentive fee, cost plus award fee, cost plus percentage of cost, and\\ncost plus fixed fee.\\n98. A. This question describes activities associated with monitoring stakeholder engagement,\\nwhich is part of the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process. Keeping stakeholders\\nengaged will help overall project success, and it will keep them up to date on issues and\\nstatus.\\n99. C. Schedule variance tells you whether the schedule is ahead or behind what was planned\\nfor this period and is calculated by subtracting PV from EV. In this case, the formula\\nlooks like this: 95 – 85 = 10. The resulting number is positive, which means the project is\\nahead of schedule for this time period.\\n100. D. The project manager and project team together are responsible for determining how\\nbest to tailor the project management processes, based on the needs of the project.\\n101. B. Bottom-up estimating is carried out by obtaining individual estimates for each project\\nactivity and then adding all of them up together to come up with a total estimate for the\\nwork package or the project. It is generally an accurate means of estimating, although it’s\\nmore time-consuming and costly to perform.\\n102. C. This describes a risk review, which is a tool and technique used within the Monitor\\nRisks process, as part of “meetings” held. According to the PMBOK® Guide, risk\\nreviews are scheduled regularly and should evaluate and capture whether risk responses\\nimplemented are effective in dealing with identified project and individual risks.\\n103. D. Project phases generally produce at least one deliverable by the end of the phase.\\n104. A. The Tuckman ladder, developed by Dr. Bruce Tuckman, is a team development model\\nthat identifies the various stages of development that a team goes through together.\\n105. C. The addition of two stakeholders brought the total number of communication channels\\nto 66. Remember that you must apply the formula for calculating communication\\nchannels, which is as follows:\\nn (n-1) ÷ 2\\nT he question, however, asks how many more communication channels you will need to\\nmanage, meaning that you must now subtract the original number of channels from the\\nnew number of channels to get the answer (66 – 45). The answer is 21.\\n106. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the issue log is used to promote communication\\nwith stakeholders. The issue log is part of the project documents updates output of this\\nprocess.\\n282 \\n107. B. Nicolas used the stakeholder engagement plan as part of carrying out the Manage\\nStakeholder Engagement process activities. The stakeholder engagement plan is a key input\\nto this process, and it documents identified strategies and actions required to promote the\\nproductive involvement of stakeholders.\\n108. B. Approved change requests are an input to the Direct and Manage Project Work\\nprocess. This process will be repeated to implement the change. Approved change requests\\ncome about as a result of the approved change requests output of the Perform Integrated\\nChange Control process. There is not enough information in the question to determine\\nwhether the scope has increased, so neither C nor D is correct.\\n109. B. Organizational process assets include historical documents from past projects, along\\nwith templates. Templates, in particular, can help expedite the preparation of network\\ndiagrams.\\n110. D. The WBS is a decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project\\nteam. As is implied, it represents 100 percent of the project’s scope, as well as objectives to\\nbe accomplished to produce the required deliverables.\\n111. B. Carina is performing activities associated with the Planning process group.\\n112. D. Parametric estimating uses mathematical models to calculate cost estimates through\\nhistorical data, resulting in a fairly accurate estimate.\\n113. B. This question requires discounted cash flow analysis to compare the value of\\nAlternative A to Alternative B. Applying the present value formula to Alternative A, the\\nformula is calculated this way: $21,000,000 / (1 + .05)2 = $19,047,619. Alternative B is\\ncalculated this way: $29,000,000 / (1 + .05)3 = $25,051,831.\\n114. B. Mandatory dependencies are also known as hard logic or hard dependencies. In a\\nmandatory dependency, the nature of the work itself dictates the order in which activities\\nshould be performed.\\n115. A. Scope changes will cause schedule revisions, but schedule revisions do not change the\\nproject scope. Project requirements are part of the project scope statement, and therefore\\noption D is one of the correct responses.\\n116. A. The question describes the Monitor Communications and Monitor Stakeholder\\nEngagement processes. Both processes evaluate the results of communication and\\nstakeholder engagement activities and compare them against the desired outcomes. Based\\non the comparison, adjustments to these activities may be made.\\n117. D. Trend analysis is a mathematical formula used to forecast future outcomes and predict\\nproject trends. It is not a tool for analyzing how problems occur. It is part of the data\\nanalysis tool and technique of the Control Costs process.\\n118. A. The triangular distribution formula using the three-point estimating technique is\\n(Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 3. Plugging in the values provided yields the\\nfollowing: ($2,500 + $3,500 + $7,200) ÷ 3 = $4,400.\\n119. C. There are four development life cycles: predictive, iterative, incremental, and hybrid.\\nThe incremental development life cycle uses predetermined periods of time called\\niterations to complete the deliverable (not to be confused with the iterative development\\nlife cycle).\\n120. A. Since the question states you are meeting to discuss details of the contract, you are\\nusing the procurement negotiation tool and technique, which is part of interpersonal\\nand team skills. Proposal evaluation is used prior to deciding among multiple responses.\\nProcurement negotiations are used to come to agreement on the contract; while the\\nproject manager may participate in contract negotiations, it is typically the procurement\\nadministrator who performs negotiations.\\n121. A. Getting this question correct involves knowing how to calculate the expected\\nmonetary value, as well as understanding decision tree analysis. The correct answer\\nis $37,250. Based on the question, our focus is on the make scenario. To calculate the\\nexpected monetary value, take the impact of $15,000 and multiply it by the probability of\\n15 percent, and then add the initial investment of $35,000.\\n122. D. There isn’t enough information in this question to determine an answer. Payback\\nperiod is the least precise of cash flow analysis techniques, but in this question, the\\npayback periods are all the same. Initial investment isn’t enough information to help\\nchoose among the projects.\\n123. A. This question describes expert power on the part of the brilliant teammate and a\\ndemocratic leadership style because team members were asked for input before a decision\\nwas made.\\n124. A. During the early stages of a project, risk probability of occurrence is at its highest;\\nuncertainty is greatest during the Initiating phase of the project.\\n125. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are three ways project life cycle phases could\\nbe performed: sequential, iterative, and overlapping.\\n126. A. The project manager has asked Yazzy to calculate estimate to complete (ETC). When\\nthe work is proceeding as planned, use the following ETC formula: EAC – AC. Plug in the\\nvalues to get the following: $75,000 – $50,000 = $25,000.\\n127. C. The team is currently in the norming stage, where they are working together well and\\nwhere team members adjust their work habits and behaviors to support the team.\\n128. A. To calculate schedule variance, subtract planned value from earned value (SV = EV –\\nPV): $500 – $700 = –$200. A negative schedule variance means that the project is behind\\nschedule.\\n129. B. Reporting templates, communication policies, communication technologies, and\\nsecurity issues surrounding data, communicating methods, and records retention policies\\nare all part of the organizational process assets input of the Monitor Communications\\nprocess, not the project communications input.\\n284 \\n130. D. What-if scenario analysis is typically performed using the Monte Carlo technique,\\nwhich simulates hundreds of scenarios by using existing project data and considering\\nuncertainty. This is used as part of modeling techniques performed through the Develop\\nSchedule and Control Schedule processes, as well as the Perform Quantitative Risk\\nAnalysis process.\\n131. B. You are in the process of carrying out the Collect Requirements process, which is part\\nof the Planning process group.\\n132. D. The project charter authorizes the project to begin. Once approved, it gives the project\\nmanager authority to apply resources to the project.\\n133. B. The project manager has carried out the Develop Project Charter and Identify\\nStakeholders processes. He will likely begin to assemble the project management plan as a\\nnext step, by performing activities outlined within the Develop Project Management Plan\\nprocess.\\n134. D. While Monitor and Control Project Work represents another great option, David is\\nlikely to place extra emphasis on the Control Scope process. This process ensures that the\\napproved scope, and only the approved scope, is completed. Any changes are managed\\naccording to the formal change control process.\\n135. C. Only critical path activities will cause schedule delays unless one or more of the\\nnoncritical-path activities have used up all their float time. This question doesn’t specify\\nthat a noncritical-path activity has used all its float time.\\n136. A. Completion of the product scope is measured against the product requirements,\\nwhereas completion of the project scope is measured against the project management\\nplan. Although requirements documentation is technically a correct answer, product\\nrequirements is a far more specific answer.\\n137. A. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the project management plan describes how the\\nproject will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed. It brings together all of the\\nsubsidiary management plans and baselines, as well as other information, to manage the\\nproject.\\n138. C. The project manager is performing the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. This\\nprocess includes activities such as engaging stakeholders at appropriate stages, managing\\ntheir expectations through negotiation and communication, addressing risks or potential\\nconcerns related to their management and anticipating future issues, and clarifying and\\nresolving issues identified.\\n139. D. The key pieces of information within the question reveal that you have accurate\\nhistorical information and quantifiable parameters. Both are needed to utilize the\\nparametric estimating technique.\\n140. C. The tools and techniques of the Acquire Resources process are pre-assignment,\\ninterpersonal and team skills (negotiation), virtual teams, and decision-making\\n(multicriterion decision analysis). Resource calendars are an output of this process.\\n141. A. ETC when variances are atypical is BAC − EV.\\n142. A. Legitimate power, also known as formal power, comes about as a result of the\\ninfluencer’s position. For example, team members may agree to go along with an executive\\nsimply as a result of their position.\\n143. C. The project manager is performing the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. This\\nprocess includes activities such as engaging stakeholders at appropriate stages, managing\\ntheir expectations through negotiation and communication, addressing risks or potential\\nconcerns related to their management and anticipating future issues, and clarifying and\\nresolving issues identified.\\n144. A, C, D. Teams are made up of individuals, and individual development is a factor critical\\nto project success.\\n145. A. Change requests are typically a means of taking corrective or preventive actions or\\nperforming defect repairs. Updates to project documents will typically occur as a result of\\nimplementing a change request.\\n146. B. Carina is concluding major activities associated with the Planning process group and\\nis getting ready to enter into Executing. At this point in the project life cycle, costs are\\ntypically low.\\n147. C. Scope changes might affect the schedule, cost, quality, and other processes and should\\nbe thoroughly integrated with all the Monitoring and Controlling processes. Scope\\nchanges may reduce the project requirements and thus reduce the number or hours needed\\nto complete the project. This, in turn, could cause a reduction in the project budget.\\n148. C. To calculate the project’s performance using the information provided, you can use the\\ncost performance index (CPI) earned value calculation. The formula for calculating CPI is\\nCPI = EV ÷ AC. Plug in the values to calculate the following: $5,000 ÷ $7,500 = $0.67. A\\nCPI of less than 1 means that the project is performing over budget.\\n149. C. Monte Carlo analysis examines risk from the perspective of the project as a whole.\\n150. D. To answer this question, you will need to calculate the cumulative SPI and CPI.\\nAll values needed to do this have been provided within the question. The formula for\\ncalculating SPI, which will tell us how the project is performing according to the schedule,\\nis EV ÷ PV. Plug in the values provided to result in the following: ($59,000 / $70,200) =\\n0.84. Anything less than 1.0 means that the project is behind schedule. Now, calculate\\nCPI by using the following formula: EV ÷ AC. Plug in the values provided to result in the\\nfollowing: ($59,000 / $64,500) = 0.91. A CPI under 1.0 means that the project is over\\nbudget. Therefore, the project is behind schedule and over budget.\\n151. C. As part of carrying out the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process, updates are\\nmade to the risk register. Among the updates are an assessment of overall project risk\\nexposure and detailed probabilistic analysis of the project.\\n152. A. Analogous estimating involves the use of historical information from past similar\\nprojects as the basis for determining the activity duration estimates. This is what the project\\nmanager has done within the question by using the estimates from the past edition’s project.\\n286 \\n153. A. Carina will update risks identified and information about the risks within the risk\\nregister. While project documents is technically a correct answer (since the risk register\\nis a project document), risk register is more specific and therefore a better choice. Her\\nfindings may also find their way into the risk report, although, again, that is a secondary\\nchoice.\\n154. B. A TCPI of 1.0 means that the project must continue performing at its current level of\\nefficiency to complete within specified targets.\\n155. C. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs notes that there are five sets of needs that must be met\\nin the following hierarchical order: basic physical needs, safety and security needs, social\\nneeds, self-esteem needs, self-actualization. The idea is that these needs must be met\\nbefore the person can move to the next level of needs in the hierarchy.\\n156. B. ADM only uses the finish-to-start dependency. Precedence diagramming method\\n(PDM), on the other hand, uses all dependency types.\\n157. C. Total float refers to the amount of time you can delay the earliest start of an activity\\nwithout delaying the ending of the project. To calculate total float, subtract either the early\\nstart from the late start or the early finish from the late finish (both give you the same\\nanswer).\\n158. C. According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, respect is our duty to\\nshow a high regard for ourselves, others, and the resources entrusted to us.\\n159. C. Work performance reports are an output of the Monitor and Control Project Work\\nprocess. These reports can take many forms and are intended to create awareness of\\nissues, provide information to make decisions, and take action regarding the issues.\\n160. C. Inspection is an important tool and technique of the Validate Scope process. The\\npurpose is to inspect work and deliverables to ensure that they meet requirements and\\nproduct acceptance criteria. If the deliverables pass inspection and receive sign-off, they\\nare formally considered accepted deliverables—a major output of this process.\\n161. A. An agreement is a mutually binding document that obligates the seller to provide a\\nspecific set of products, services, or results. It typically contains a lot of information, such\\nas the procurement statement of work or major deliverables, when the goods or services\\nwill be produced, reporting, associated terms, and other relevant information. Agreements\\nare an output of the Conduct Procurements process.\\n162. A, B, D. Referent power refers to power that is inferred to the influencer by their\\nsubordinates. For example, project team members may have a high level of regard for\\ntheir project manager and therefore willingly go along with a decision that the PM makes.\\nFormal power is also known as legitimate power, not referent power.\\n163. D. Quality improvements come about as a result of quality audits, which are a tool and\\ntechnique of the Manage Quality process. Quality improvements are implemented by\\nsubmitting change requests and/or taking corrective action.\\n164. A. Supportive PMOs tend to have a low degree of control over projects and play more\\nof a consultative role in projects. Typically, a supportive PMO provides best practices,\\ntemplates, training, and other resources to support projects.\\n165. A. This describes the cost-benefit analysis tool and technique of the Plan Quality\\nManagement process.\\n166. C. Costs are highest during the Executing phase of the project life cycle, when resource\\nusage is at its highest.\\n167. A. The formula for CPI is EV ÷ AC; therefore, 114 ÷ 103 = 1.1. The formula for SPI is\\nEV ÷ PV; therefore, 114 ÷ 120 = .95.\\n168. A, C, D. A backlog contains a prioritized list of all work encapsulated in a project. It is\\nused to track, review, and regulate work. The team generally pulls work from the top of the\\nbacklog, and the backlog is continuously refined over the course of the project. The product\\nowner is responsible for maintaining the backlog and is a representative of the business.\\n169. A. The question is asking for an input that can be used to address the engagement level\\nof stakeholders. The scenario involves the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process.\\nInterpersonal and team skills and decision-making are tools and techniques and therefore\\nnot the correct choices. Since the project management plan contains the stakeholder\\nengagement plan, which documents the strategy for engagement stakeholders, this is the\\nbest option. Other useful components of the project management plan also include the\\ncommunications management plan and resource management plan.\\n170. B. The team is engaged in the Estimate Costs process. The purpose of this process is to\\ndevelop an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project work.\\n171. C. Project management processes are often revisited several times as the project is refined\\nthroughout its life and are therefore performed in an iterative fashion throughout the\\nproject’s life cycle.\\n172. C. What the project sponsor is looking for is an updated project schedule that reflects\\nwhere the project is currently at in terms of work accomplished. The schedule baseline\\ncontains the planned information, not actual work progress. Instead, the schedule baseline\\nis typically compared to the current project schedule to determine what variances exist.\\n173. D. This question describes the process analysis tool and technique. Process analysis looks\\nat process improvements from an organizational and technical perspective. It examines\\nproblems and constraints experienced while conducting the work of the project, and it\\nidentifies inefficient and ineffective processes.\\n174. B. The correct answer is contingency reserve, which are funds set aside for responding to\\nrisk that remain after carrying out the risk response plan. Management reserves are funds\\nthat have been set aside to cover unforeseen risks. Cost aggregation deals with aggregating\\ncost estimates, so was a clear elimination, and cash flow refers to needed, or used, funds.\\n175. A. While it’s true that gathering three-point estimates helps to generate estimates with\\nhigher accuracy, this is a technique that we use to generate duration estimates, not\\nresource estimates. All other statements are accurate.\\n176. D. Estimate at completion (EAC) is the expected cost of the work when completed.\\n177. B. The project management plan contains the procurement management plan, which will\\nserve as a guide to carrying out procurement-related activities.\\n288 \\n178. D. The project manager has just completed the Direct and Manage Project Work\\nprocess, eliminating this as the best option. Although the Executing and Monitoring\\nand Controlling processes are iterative and overlap, the best choice of those presented is\\nthe Monitor and Control Project Work process. This process is responsible for tracking,\\nreviewing, and reporting overall progress against the plan. In this case, results and\\nperformance of the deliverable produced will be evaluated against the plan. While it is\\npossible that change control is another process that will be performed (many times on any\\ngiven project), you do not have sufficient information to select this as the best option.\\n179. D. Communications requirements analysis, a tool and technique of the Plan\\nCommunications Management process, considers things such as company and\\ndepartmental organization charts, stakeholder relationships, all the departments and\\ndisciplines involved in the project, the number of people associated with the project\\nand their location, and any external needs like the media, government, or industry\\norganizations requiring communication updates.\\n180. A. Corrective actions are taken as a result of comparing and monitoring project\\nperformance against the baseline. The baseline is the project management plan. Deviations\\nthat are discovered during the course of the project may or may not require corrective\\nactions. Preventive actions are taken to reduce the probability of negative consequences,\\nand defect repairs are submitted to correct product defects.\\n181. B. System or process flow charts show how the various elements of a system interrelate,\\nwhich can reveal how a problem occurs. This is done by analyzing the steps of a system\\nand is useful in identifying potential responses to risks.\\n182. D. The Closing process group encompasses only one process, not Initiating. Initiating has\\na total of 2 processes, Planning a total of 24, Executing a total of 10, and Monitoring and\\nControlling a total of 12.\\n183. D. Once a seller is selected, resource calendars will be generated for the resources\\nprocured. This displays the availability of those resources.\\n184. B. The risk manager has omitted the initial process of risk management, which involves\\ncreating the risk management plan. The risk management plan is an essential part of\\ncarrying out the other risk management processes, since it outlines how risks will be\\nidentified, analyzed, monitored, and so forth. Therefore, the project manager in this\\nscenario has a low likelihood of developing a risk register that will be useful in carrying\\nout risk management. For exam purposes, the risk management plan is a requirement.\\n185. B. Personal work styles, scheduling priorities, and scarce resources are the top three\\nreasons for conflict. The correct answer is therefore personality clashes.\\n186. B. Velocity refers to the average cycle time or stories completed per iteration. This is used\\nby the team to predict how long the project will take, assuming that the velocity calculated\\nis reliable.\\n187. D. Both processes are responsible for carrying out closure activities when it comes to\\nprocurements. The closed procurements output is a result of Control Procurements,\\nwhere completed requirements are validated against the contract; administrative closure\\nof procurements occurs through the Close Project or Phase process, including archiving\\nrelated documentation.\\n188. D. The project manager will need to measure scope completed against scope planned. To\\ndo this, they will need work performance data, a key input of the Control Scope process.\\nVariance and trend analysis are tools and techniques of the process, not inputs.\\n189. A. The project scope statement contains a list of the project deliverables, their\\nrequirements, and the measurable criteria used to determine project completion. The\\nproject scope statement is an output of the Define Scope process and is used as an input to\\nthe Create WBS process.\\n190. B. Carina is using the earned value analysis technique of the Control Costs process.\\nEarned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline against actual\\nperformance, such as actual schedule progress and costs.\\n191. C. The project objectives should include quantifiable criteria that can be used to help\\nmeasure project success. Project objectives should include schedule, cost, and quality\\nmeasurements.\\n192. B. Waterfall, Agile, and PRINCE2 are examples of methodologies used to manage projects.\\n193. A. Expected value is calculated as follows: (Optimistic + Pessimistic + (4 × Most Likely)) ÷ 6.\\nThe formula is as follows: ($75 + $250 + (4 × $100)) ÷ 6 = $120.83.\\n194. A. According to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, project management\\npractitioners should adhere to the following four values: responsibility, respect, fairness,\\nand honesty.\\n195. C. Weighted scoring models use the weight of the criteria multiplied by the score to derive\\nan overall score. Project 1’s score is 47, Project 2’s score is 45, and Project 3’s score is 42.\\nBased on this information, Project 1 is the best choice.\\n196. C. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that changes are managed properly\\nthroughout the project’s life cycle and that the organization’s change control policies are\\nfollowed.\\n197. A. With the Just in Time strategy, inventory costs are brought in just as they are needed.\\nBut to implement this type of strategy, a company must be highly efficient and have a high\\nfocus on quality, or the strategy won’t work, and the goods will arrive either too early or\\ntoo late.\\n198. C. A burndown chart shows how much work remains versus how much time is left\\nwithin a timebox. Examples of timebox include time remaining for the current or a future\\niteration, or it may reflect time remaining for the project.\\n199. B. Attributes sampling is an inspection measurement technique with only two\\npossibilities: conforming or nonconforming. In other words, the measurements conform\\n(meet the requirement), or they do not conform. This can also be considered a pass/fail or\\ngo/no-go decision.\\n200. A-2, B-1, C-3. Project management always includes planning activities, regardless of the\\nlife cycle used to carry out the project. While all share planning as a key activity, when\\nand how planning occurs varies for each.'"

    "answer_text='1. D. Virtual teams create opportunities to expand the resource pool across many geographic\\nareas and increase the likelihood of acquiring special expertise. With team members\\nengaging virtually, cost can be reduced by limiting travel and allowing team members to\\nwork remotely.\\n2. D. Within Agile there is a concept that describes the degree to which individuals can take\\non work, according to their depth and breadth. “I” shaped people are those who have\\ndeep specializations in one domain and rarely contribute to work outside of that domain;\\n“T” shaped people are considered generalizing specialists who have expertise in an area\\nbut can also contribute to other areas.\\n3. B, D. PMOs may facilitate project audits as a means of monitoring compliance against\\npublished standards, policies, and procedures published by the PMO and/or the company.\\nA key benefit of project audits is that they serve as a tool for identifying potential threats\\nto compliance, such as legal or contractual requirements.\\n4. A-3, B-1, C-4, D-2. There are four types of project endings: integration, starvation,\\naddition, and extinction. Extinction is the best type of ending.\\n5. B. Earned value (EV) is the value of the work that’s actually been completed. Planned value\\n(PV) is the budgeted amount planned for work to be completed during a given time period,\\nand actual cost (AC) is the cost of work completed during a given time period. EAC is a\\nforecasting technique that is an estimate of the expected total cost of a work component.\\n6. A. RACI charts are part of the organization charts and position. A RACI is a type of\\nresponsibility descriptions tool and technique of the Plan Resource Management process.\\nThey are matrix-based charts, but matrix-based charts are part of the organization charts\\nand position descriptions tool and technique.\\n7. C. There are three common roles used in Agile teams: cross-functional team member,\\nproduct owner, and team facilitator.\\n8. E. Diversity and inclusion are important elements to consider when acquiring project team\\nmembers.\\n9. D. Since payback period is the least precise cash flow analysis technique, IRR values have\\na higher priority in determining go or no-go project decisions.\\n10. D. All team members, not just the project manager, should exhibit emotional intelligence.\\nThese skills enable the team to respond to changes and adapt to the work and each other.\\n11. B. The cost management technique used when evaluating various alternatives is called\\nlife-cycle costing. This technique considers acquisition, operating, and disposal costs.\\n12. A, D. Organizations interested in adopting Agile practices or other new cultural norms\\nmust foster and enable an environment that is safe, honest, and transparent. This type of\\nenvironment encourages the team to move forward and avoid falling into old behaviors\\nand practices.\\n13. C. Pre-assignments occur when team members are determined in advance. Typically, the\\npre-assignment is formally captured within the project charter or committed as part of a\\nproject proposal.\\n14. A-5, B-2, C-1, D-4, E-3. There are five conflict resolution techniques, all of which go by\\ntwo different names: withdraw/avoid, smooth/accommodate, compromise/reconcile, force/\\ndirect, collaborate/problem-solve.\\n15. C. Alyssa is performing the Develop Project Management Plan process. The only output\\nof this process is the project management plan.\\n16. A, C, D. The activities list is a key element of the project schedule that will form the\\nschedule baseline. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the scope baseline consists of the\\nfollowing: the project scope statement, WBS, work packages, planning packages, and\\nWBS dictionary.\\n17. D. Walter Shewhart is considered to be the grandfather of TQM; he developed statistical\\ntools to examine when a corrective action must be applied to a process.\\n18. D. Project managers can use a variety of individual and team assessments to gain insight\\ninto areas of strengths and weaknesses. Examples of this tool include surveys that capture\\nteam member preferences, structured interviews, ability tests, and focus groups.\\n19. C. There are three types of PMOs: supportive, controlling, and directive. Controlling\\nPMOs are concerned with providing project teams with support, such as through\\npublished resources and templates, and ensuring compliance with published project\\nmanagement and governance frameworks.\\n20. A. The Perform Integrated Change Control process is carried out as part of monitoring\\nand controlling the activities, which occurs in conjunction with execution activities but is\\nnot itself considered part of the Executing process group.\\n21. B. The project management plan describes how the project will be executed, monitored\\nand controlled, and closed. It addresses the various elements of how the project will be\\nmanaged, including any methodology that will be used.\\n22. A, B, D. Common causes of variance that fall outside the acceptable range are difficult to\\ncorrect and usually require reorganization of the process. Decisions to change the process\\nare not within the project manager’s authority and always require management approval.\\nThe rule of seven refers to when seven or more processes fall on the same side of the\\nmedian; this indicates that an external factor may be influencing the results.\\n23. B. At the end of the meeting, the project manager took a compromising approach, also\\nreferred to as reconciling. This is when an individual attempts to bring about some degree\\nof satisfaction to all parties to partially resolve the conflict. The project manager did\\nthis by increasing the priority of user story #2 and allowing for the possibility of it being\\npulled into the iteration.\\n24. A. Legitimate power, also referred to as formal power, comes about as a result of\\nsomeone’s position or formal title. In this case, the division president’s directive carries a\\nheavy influence due to her position.\\n292 \\n25. C. When building a team, project managers must take several factors into account.\\nOne tool used as part of the decision-making process is multicriteria decision analysis.\\nAvailability, cost, and ability are examples of team member selection criteria that a\\nproject manager may use. Availability, cost, and ability may be assumptions or constraints\\ncaptured but are not considered ongoing.\\n26. D. The assumption log contains both assumptions and constraints and is first created\\nduring the Develop Project Charter process.\\n27. C. A fixed-price contract can either set a specific, firm price for the goods or services\\nrendered or include incentives for meeting or exceeding certain contract deliverables.\\nThere are three types of fixed-price contracts: firm fixed-price, fixed-price incentive fee,\\nand fixed-price with economic price adjustment.\\n28. B. The requisition stage is where the procurement documents are prepared (not the responses\\nto them) and is associated with the Plan Procurement Management process. The two outputs\\nthat become inputs are procurement documentation and source selection criteria.\\n29. A-5, B-1, C-3, D-2, E-4. Classifying stakeholder engagement levels and documenting\\nthem helps plan and create action plans for those stakeholders who are not at the desired\\nlevel of engagement.\\n30. C. The stakeholder engagement plan captures the strategies used to promote productive\\ninvolvement of stakeholders throughout the project. While the stakeholder engagement\\nplan is a component of the project management plan, identifying the component itself is a\\nmore specific and therefore better answer.\\n31. B. There are three common roles used in Agile teams: cross-functional team member,\\nproduct owner, and team facilitator.\\n32. C. Generating status reports is an activity that belongs to the Monitor and Control\\nProject Work process, which is part of the Monitoring and Controlling process group. The\\nkey output of this process is work performance reports.\\n33. D. Lack of executive buy-in occurs when leaders are accustomed to a predictive mindset\\nand approaches. A new way of working may be difficult to understand without education\\nand training. The Agile Practice Guide also recommends describing Agile terms using lean\\nthinking, such as frequent reviews.\\n34. B, C, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are three main categories to consider\\nwhen choosing a methodology to manage the work of the project. They are culture of the\\norganization, the project team, and the project itself.\\n35. D. Kanban follows a lean approach using a pull-based scheduling system, also referred to\\nas on-demand scheduling, to maintain flexibility and focus on continuous delivery. This\\npull system involves moving work through a process in a visual manner using a Kanban\\nboard.\\n36. C. Proposal evaluation techniques are a tool and technique of this process. It is also an\\nexample of source selection criteria, which are an input to this process and may also\\ninclude financial capacity and technical capability.\\n37. A. The sponsor is referring to benefits. According to the PMBOK® Guide, project\\nbenefits are defined as outcomes of actions, behaviors, products, services, or results\\nthat provide value to the sponsoring organization as well as to the project’s intended\\nbeneficiaries.\\n38. D. Assessing risk probability is difficult because it relies on expert judgment; the other\\noptions listed are not used during this process.\\n39. D. Developing the project team sets up the team for success, but it is also a strategy that\\ncreates an open, encouraging environment that enables team members to contribute.\\n40. A, B, C. According to the Agile Practice Guide, colocation improves communication,\\nincreases knowledge sharing, enables team member commitment to each other and the\\nproject, and creates a low-cost continuous learning environment.\\n41. C. Expert power occurs when the person being influenced believes that the person doing\\nthe influencing is knowledgeable about the subject. In this case, the division president felt\\nthat your experience and knowledge gave merit to your advice.\\n42. C. The Executing process group is where you should execute the work defined within the\\nplan and implement corrective and preventive actions as they are approved. The primary\\nfocus of the Monitoring and Controlling process group is to take measurements and\\nperform inspections to find out whether there are variances in the plan.\\n43. D. This question describes the Conduct Procurements process. Make-or-buy decisions\\nis one of the inputs of this process, and bidder conferences and proposal evaluation\\ntechniques are two of the tools and techniques of this process. Since you know the vendor,\\neven though you haven’t seen this person recently, you should be concerned about a\\nconflict-of-interest situation.\\n44. A, B, D. Agile project management offices (PMOs) exist to guide the organization in\\ncontinuously achieving business value. According to the Agile Practice Guide, an Agile\\nPMO is value-driven, invitation-oriented, and multidisciplinary.\\n45. B, C, D. Project managers are continuously using interpersonal and team skills to\\nperform their daily work. Among these skills, project managers often must use negotiation\\ntechniques to build the project team and acquire the skills and capabilities needed.\\nNegotiation often occurs with functional managers, other project managers, and vendors/\\nsuppliers that are external to the organization.\\n46. A. Virtual teams often reduce project or organizational costs; while costs may be\\ndispersed across regions, this is highly scenario-dependent and not always applicable or\\nthe case. All other options are valid benefits of using virtual teams.\\n47. C. Implementing approved changes occurs as part of the Direct and Manage Project Work\\nprocess, which is part of the Executing process group.\\n48. C. This Agile methodology is grounded in governance framework that combines the\\niterative and incremental approaches. At the onset of the project, DDSM establishes the\\ncost of the project, the quality standards, and the timeframe to completion and, as such, is\\nconstraint-driven.\\n294 \\n49. B. The lowest level of the WBS is the work package. Work packages are later decomposed\\nfurther into activities as part of developing the schedule. Activities, however, are not\\nconsidered to be part of the WBS.\\n50. D. Within a strong matrix organization, project managers have moderate to high\\nauthority, report into a functional manager, and directly manage the project budget; they\\nare full-time project managers with a job title that reflects the role.\\n51. C. This question describes the affinity diagram, which is a data representation tool and\\ntechnique. Affinity diagrams pinpoint which areas should get the most focus by grouping\\nrelated potential causes of defects.\\n52. B. Crystal methods refers to a family of methodologies designed to scale to the project\\nneeds. It is multifaceted, with each face representing a core value. The core values of\\nCrystal are people, interaction, community, communication, skills, and talents.\\n53. A. The Role Delineation Study covered in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional\\nConduct covers four areas, including promoting interaction among team members and\\nother stakeholders. This question describes the purpose of the Manage Stakeholder\\nEngagement process.\\n54. C. Ground rules refer to the expectations established by the team of acceptable behaviors\\nthey are to exhibit. Ground rules are typically captured as part of the team charter. They\\nbecome an important tool to use when managing stakeholder engagement.\\n55. B. The sponsor is referring to benefits. The benefits management plan describes how and\\nwhen the benefits of the project will be delivered. It captures the target benefits, strategic\\nalignment, timeframe for realizing benefits, metrics of how the benefits will be measured,\\nand benefit owners, among other key information relating to business value delivered.\\n56. D. Expected value can be calculated using a triangular distribution (simple average)\\nor beta distribution (weighted average). The three-point estimating formula that uses a\\ntriangular distribution is as follows: (Optimistic + Pessimistic + Most Likely) ÷ 3. Plug in\\nthe values provided to calculate the following: ($25 + $50 + $35) ÷ 3 = $36.7, or 37 when\\nrounded to the nearest whole number.\\n57. D. Data representation can include the use of a stakeholder engagement matrix to\\nassess whether communication needs are being met. In this scenario, the Monitor\\nCommunications process is being carried out.\\n58. B. Interactional is a leadership style that encompasses a mixture of three styles:\\ntransactional, transformational, and charismatic. Transactional refers to a leader\\nwho focuses on goals, feedback, and accomplishments when determining rewards;\\ntransformational refers to a leader who empowers followers through idealized attributes\\nand behaviors, and encourages innovation and creativity; and charismatic refers to a\\nleader who leads by inspiring followers, who creates high energy around them, and who\\ntends to hold strong convictions.\\n59. D. The Tuckman ladder, also referred to as stages of team development, consists of\\nfive stages that teams may go through: forming, storming, norming, performing, and\\nadjourning. The performing stage is where the team experiences peak performance. They\\nare most productive and effective during this stage.\\n60. A. The question refers to the Direct and Manage Project Work process, which is\\nresponsible for leading and performing the work defined in the project management\\nplan and implementing any changes that have been approved. This is where the project\\nmanager provides the overall management of the work being executed. Inputs to this\\nprocess include the project management plan, project documents, approved change\\nrequests, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets. Expert\\njudgment is a tool and technique, while issue log and work performance data are outputs\\nof the process.\\n61. D. Project 1’s payback period is 19 months. Year 1 inflows are $528,000. Year 2 inflows\\nare $39,000 per month, making the total payback period 19 months. Project 2’s payback\\nperiod is 16 months. Year 1 inflows are $72,000. Year 2 inflows are $45,000 per month,\\nwhich makes the payback period 16 months.\\n62. A. Since you’ve identified the risks, you’ve completed the Identify Risks process.\\n63. A. Options C and D are not viable responses because the question is asking for an\\nestimate at completion, not an estimate to complete. When changes in performance or\\nrisks occur on the project, it may cause BAC to no longer make sense. When that is the\\ncase, switch to the EAC to project the cost at completion.\\n64. D. Knowledge can be split into two types: explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge can be\\ncaptured and expressed using words, pictures, and numbers; tacit knowledge is more\\ndifficult to capture or express, such as beliefs, experiences, and “know-how.”\\n65. C. According to the Agile Practice Guide, servant leaders practice and exude Agile. They\\napproach their work in the following order: purpose (work with the team to define the\\n“why”), people (encourage the team to create an environment where all can succeed), and\\nprocess (look for results).\\n66. C. Cross-cultural communication presents unique challenges, particularly in ensuring\\nthat the meaning of a message is understood. This occurs through differences in\\ncommunication styles (i.e., age, nationality, ethnicity, gender), use of different languages,\\nand varying processes and protocols.\\n67. D. A salience model is a method used to classify stakeholders based on an assessment of\\ntheir degree of authority/power, urgency, and legitimacy.\\n68. A. The project management plan is a compilation of plans and baselines and is considered\\nto represent the project baseline. Once work is executed, progress will be measured\\nagainst this plan.\\n69. A, B. The question describes the Scrum framework, and the technique referenced is the\\nfacilitation of sprint retrospective meetings (in Scrum, iterations are referred to sprints).\\nSprint retrospectives are held to determine what went well, what could be improved for\\nthe next sprint, and any changes needed to the scope.\\n70. E. Teams that are geographically disbursed can still benefit from common virtual\\nworkspaces. The Agile Practice Guide provides two examples: creating a fishbowl window\\nthrough an ongoing videoconferencing link between various locations, which is live\\nthrough the workday, and setting up remote pairing through virtual conferencing tools\\nthat allow for screen, video, and audio sharing capabilities.\\n296 \\n71. C. Precedence diagramming method (PDM) is the most frequently used diagramming\\nmethod. PDM uses boxes to represent activities and connects the activities with arrows\\nshowing the dependencies between them. PDM is also known as activity on node (AON).\\n72. B. Agile teams focus on measuring value and what the team delivers versus what the team\\npredicted it would deliver. Measurements tend to be empirical and value-based in nature.\\n73. B. You are in the Manage Quality process. This process is responsible for translating\\nthe quality management plan into executable-quality activities that incorporate the\\norganization’s quality policies into the project.\\n74. B, C, D. The sender/receiver communication model includes three key components:\\nencode, transmit, and decode. Encoding is where the sender puts the information into a\\nlanguage the receiver will understand; transmit refers to sending the message using an\\nappropriate method; and decode is where the receiver translates the information that\\nwas sent.\\n75. C. The team charter, also referred to as the team’s social contract, creates an Agile\\nenvironment that enables team members to work to the best of their ability as a team.\\n76. C. Acquiring resources involves activities required to obtain team members, facilities,\\nequipment, materials, supplies, and other resources necessary to complete the work of the\\nproject.\\n77. C. Analogous estimating is less time-consuming than other estimating techniques and can\\nbe used to estimate time for different phases on the project. Analogous estimating is not as\\naccurate as other estimating techniques.\\n78. B. Late finish is calculated by subtracting the duration of the last activity (activity 4) from\\nits start date. Since it is one day, that means the late finish is 6/4. Late start is 7 days prior\\nto 6/4, which is 5/29.\\n79. C. To calculate the early start and early finish for activity 4, you need to perform a\\nforward pass. This is done by adding the duration of activity 4 to the early finish date of\\nactivity 3.\\n80. A. First you need to calculate the standard deviation for this activity, which is 1.67.\\nThat is, (Pessimistic – Optimistic) ÷ 6. A 95.44 percent confidence factor is 3 standard\\ndeviations. That is, 1.67 × 3 = 5.01. The expected value is 23 days, so you have a 95.44\\npercent chance of completing the activity within between 18 and 28 days.\\n81. D. The resource management plan captures how resources will be categorized, allocated,\\nmanaged, and released. As part of team management, the plan details training strategies\\nneeded for team members.\\n82. B. Agile practices are highly adaptable to change and regularly assess the need for change\\nand evolving requirements. In this scenario, changing requirements would require an\\nassessment and refinement of the backlog with the consultation of the team.\\n83. C. This question describes the Validate Scope process. The tools and techniques of this\\nprocess are inspection and decision-making.\\n84. A. Agile release planning is a tool and technique of the Develop Schedule process.\\nAccording to the PMBOK® Guide, it provides a high-level summary timeline of the\\nrelease schedule and helps the team determine the number of iterations or sprints needed\\nto complete the release.\\n85. C. Lateral thinking is a form of alternatives analysis often used to determine a project’s\\nscope. It was created by Edward de Bono and serves as a means of reasoning and thinking\\nabout problems differently than what can be classified as evident.\\n86. D. Collaborating, also known as problem-solving, is where individuals adopt a\\ncooperative attitude and create open dialogue in order to reach consensus and\\ncommitment to resolving conflict. This type of approach leads to a win-win situation.\\n87. A, B, C. Good leaders use referent power, which is inferred to them by their subordinates.\\nThey are visionaries and are concerned with the big picture, or strategic direction and\\nplans.\\n88. A-1, B-1, C-2, D-2, E-1. Projects are heavily influenced by the environment that they\\noperate within. There are two major categories that influence projects: enterprise\\nenvironmental factors and organizational process assets.\\n89. C. The formula for TCPI when targeting EAC is as follows: TCPI = (BAC – EV) ÷ (EAC – AC).\\nPlug in the values to get the following: ($15,000 – $10,000) ÷ ($17,000 – $12,000) = $1.0.\\n90. C. According to the Agile Practice Guide, backlog refinement is defined as the progressive\\nelaboration of project requirements and / or the ongoing activity in which the team\\nreviews, updates, and writes requirements to satisfy the need of the customer. Other\\ndefinitions provided refer to the product backlog, progressive elaboration, and sprint\\nreview.\\n91. B, C, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, sources of conflict include scarce resources,\\nscheduling priorities, and personal work styles. Having team ground rules, group norms,\\nand project management practices (i.e., communication planning and role definition) are\\nways of reducing conflict.\\n92. D. Rewards and recognition systems are formal ways of promoting desirable behavior. In\\nthis scenario, the engineer has delivered against commitments but has not lived up to the\\nteam charter and exhibited behavior that benefits the team.\\n93. D. Paul’s benefits management plan is lacking the implementation of a system that will\\ntrack and measure benefits to ensure that value is achieved as expected.\\n94. B. The risk probability and impact assessment tool and technique is used to determine\\nthe likelihood the risk will occur and the potential effects on project objectives. After\\nperforming the assessment, you’ll determine risk scores or conditions (red, yellow, green)\\nusing the probability and impact matrix.\\n95. B. To calculate lines of communication, use the following formula, where n represents\\ntotal number of stakeholders: n(n – 1) ÷ 2. Next, plug in 15 in place of the n to get the\\nanswer: 15(15 – 1) ÷ 2 = 105.\\n298 \\n96. B. When joining a new organization, it is important that a project manager familiarize\\nthemselves with the organization’s culture. Understanding how the organization operates,\\nits tolerance level, and its appetite for risk, among other things, will help Kristin tailor\\nher project management approach and better understand the behaviors and norms of the\\nteam.\\n97. A, B, D. When managing project teams, many conflicts come about as a result of\\nscheduling issues, availability of resources, or personal work habits.\\n98. A. An incremental life cycle focuses on completing deliverables by the end of each\\niteration so that it may be turned over to the customer for use.\\n99. D. The formula for calculating lines of communication is as follows, where n represents\\nthe total number of stakeholders (you are already assumed to have been included in the\\nnumber): n(n – 1) ÷ 2. Plug in the numbers to get the following: 45(45 − 1) ÷ 2 = 990.\\n100. D. The RAM and RACI charts, which are included as a component of the Organization\\nCharts and Position Descriptions tool and technique, are matrix-based charts.\\n101. D. The team charter provides the full team with an understanding of how they will work\\ntogether. It aligns the team on team values, working agreements, ground rules, meeting\\nguidelines, and other group norms.\\n102. C. Knowledge can be split into two types: explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge can be\\ncaptured and expressed using words, pictures, and numbers; tacit knowledge is more\\ndifficult to capture or express, such as beliefs, experiences, and “know-how.”\\n103. B, C, D. Estimate Activity Resources is a process that belongs to the Project Resource\\nManagement Knowledge Area. All other statements are true.\\n104. A, D. In flow-based Agile, the focus is on the team’s throughput. Questions posed during\\nstand-ups include the following: What do we need to do to advance this piece of work?\\nIs anyone working on anything that is not on the board? What do we need to finish as a\\nteam? Are there any bottlenecks or blockers to the flow of work?\\n105. C. The project manager is carrying out activities associated with the Estimate Activity\\nResources process. Activities of this process include estimating team resources and the\\ntype and quantities of material, equipment, and supplies needed to carry out the project\\nwork.\\n106. B. There are several viable options included, most notably controlling the schedule and\\nresources. Since the project manager is currently negotiating for resources, the best option\\nis controlling resources, which are activities that occur through a project management\\nprocess called Control Resources. As part of this process, the project manager uses their\\ninterpersonal and team skills to influence and negotiate for resources.\\n107. D. While there may be multiple gaps within the team charter, one that is likely to emerge\\nis the lack of decision-making criteria.\\n108. C. Although enterprise environmental factors (i.e., marketplace conditions, changing\\nfederal regulations) are out of a project manager’s control, they may result in an outcome\\nthat affects a project. A project manager should be regularly surveying both internal and\\nexternal changes to the business environment to appropriately identify and manage risk to\\nthe project.\\n109. A. Kaylee and Alyssa are using the Monte Carlo analysis, which simulates the combined\\neffects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to determine their\\npotential impact on the project objectives.\\n110. C. In this scenario, you are using a combination of push and interactive communication\\nmethods to address team members. Push is one-way communication and refers to sending\\ninformation to intended receivers (such as email, in this case); interactive communication\\ninvolves multidirectional communication where two or more parties exchange thoughts or\\nideas (such as during meetings).\\n111. B. You can plot the degree of certainty (or agreement) about the complexity elements such\\nas requirements or team skills on a Stacey Complexity Model. The degrees are measured\\nfrom low uncertainty or agreement to high uncertainty or lack of agreement. This model\\ndisplays levels of uncertainty from low to high on both the x- and y-axes, or it may show\\nlevels of uncertainty on the x-axis and agreement levels on the y-axis.\\n112. C. The Expectancy Theory was developed by Victor Vroom. He believed that the\\nexpectation of a positive outcome, in other words, individual values, drives motivation.\\n113. B. Claims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and managing contested\\nchanges. Contested changes are resolved using alternative dispute resolution processes,\\nsuch as arbitration, when parties cannot reach an agreement.\\n114. C. Projects that have high degrees of ambiguity and change require frequent and quick\\ncommunication. Communicating frequently and transparently is a common characteristic\\nof Agile approaches.\\n115. A. Looking at the scenario from Bob’s perspective, he conceded his position to maintain\\nharmony within the meeting. This conflict resolution technique is referred to as smoothing\\nor accommodating.\\n116. C. Douglas McGregor is responsible for defining two models of worker behavior, Theory\\nX and Theory Y, which attempt to explain how different managers deal with employees.\\n117. B. Alyssa is performing the Develop Project Management Plan process. The purpose of\\nthis process is to define, prepare, and coordinate all plan components and consolidate\\nthem into an integrated project management plan. It is also at this critical point that a\\nstrategy for how the project will be managed is made.\\n118. C. When competencies or skills are lacking within the team, one option is to incorporate\\ntraining to enhance the competencies. Examples of training include classroom, distance\\nlearning, on-the-job training, mentorship, and coaching.\\n300 \\n119. D. When taking on a servant leadership approach, project managers shift to emphasize\\ncoaching those open to the help, fostering high collaboration across the team, aligning\\nstakeholder needs, and encouraging the distribution of responsibility to the team.\\n120. D. Transitioning to Agile approaches can be difficult and confusing for those not familiar\\nor accustomed to this way of working. One method of gaining adoption is to begin using\\nhybrid approaches that combine both predictive and Agile approaches as a means of\\nintroducing the team to Agile.\\n121. A. The servant leadership approach centers around empowering the team. A leader using\\nthis approach focuses on addressing the needs and development of team members to yield\\nthe greatest team performance possible. A servant leader approaches project work by\\nclarifying or creating purpose (the “why”) for the project/work, focusing on people by\\nencouraging an environment where all can be successful, and lastly, they focus on process\\nby looking for results.\\n122. A. Douglas McGregor defined two models of worker behavior: Theory X and Theory Y.\\nYour new manager exhibits characteristics of Theory X managers, who believe that most\\npeople do not like work, have little to no ambition, and need constant supervision.\\n123. C. The main purpose of the Control Quality process tools and techniques is to examine\\nthe product, service, or result as well as the project processes for conformity to standards.\\nThey are used with the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle to help identify and resolve problems\\nrelated to quality defects.\\n124. B. CPI = EV ÷ AC, or in this example, $2,100 ÷ $2,000 = $1.05. SPI = EV ÷ PV, or in this\\nexample, $2,100 ÷ $2,200 = $.95.\\n125. D. It is important to create an environment that fosters adherence to team ground rules.\\nIn this scenario, your colleague must manage and rectify the ground rule violations. As a\\nfirst step, your colleague should address the issue with the engineer directly to understand\\nwhy he or she is behaving in such a manner. If the issue does not resolve, then escalation\\nmay be a necessary next step.\\n126. D. Scrumban is a hybrid methodology that combines Scrum and Kanban. The idea is\\nthat the work is organized in sprints, as in traditional Scrum, but uses a Kanban board to\\ndisplay the work of the sprint and monitor work in progress.\\n127. D. There are five levels of classification of stakeholder engagement: unaware, resistant,\\nneutral, supportive, and leading. A stakeholder that is neutral is neither supporting nor\\nresisting the project and may be minimally engaged.\\n128. D. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs suggests that once a lower-level need has been met, it\\nno longer serves as a motivator, and the next higher level becomes the driving motivator\\nin an individual’s life. A person goes up and down the pyramid, depending on what\\nthey are experiencing in their life. The lowest level is basic physical needs (shelter,\\nclothing, food), followed by safety and security, social needs, self-esteem needs, and\\nself-actualization.\\n129. C. The SV for this project is –25, which means the project is behind schedule. The CV\\nfor this project is 50, which means the costs are lower than what you had planned for this\\npoint in time.\\n130. A, B. The Five-Factor Model, also known as the Big Five personality traits, is a\\npersonality survey that identifies five broad dimensions used to describe an individual’s\\npersonality. The five factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,\\nagreeableness, and neuroticism.\\n131. D. Enterprise environmental factors are defined as those factors that are internal and\\nexternal to the organization that can influence the project. Examples include marketplace\\nconditions, federal regulations, and the organization’s culture and structure.\\n132. C. The team is using bottom-up estimating. This technique estimates costs associated\\nwith every activity individually and then rolls them up to derive either a more accurate\\nactivity-level estimate or a total project estimate.\\n133. A. The stakeholder register is the project artifact where information about identified\\nstakeholders is captured. The stakeholder register typically includes identification\\ninformation, assessment information, and stakeholder classification.\\n134. B, C, D. The stakeholder register contains the identified stakeholders and information\\nabout them. This includes identification information, assessment information, and\\nstakeholder classification. The team ground rules are captured within the team charter.\\n135. E. According to the PMBOK® Guide, activities associated with Project Resource\\nManagement should be tailored to the unique needs of the project and organization,\\nincluding diversity of the team, physical location of team members, industry-specific\\nresources needed, acquisition of team members, management of the team, and life cycle\\napproaches used.\\n136. D. Team-building activities help increase collaboration and cooperation within the\\nworking environment. These types of activities also help team members bond and build\\nsocial relationships that help them work more effectively together, creating a win-win\\nsituation.\\n137. A. Screening systems use predefined performance criteria or a set of defined minimum\\nrequirements to screen out unsuitable vendors.\\n138. C. When projects end prematurely, the Validate Scope process is where the level of detail\\nconcerning the amount of work completed should be documented.\\n139. A, B, D. The underlying success factors in forming effective Agile teams are building a\\nfoundational trust and safe working environment, as well as an Agile mindset.\\n140. A. Culture can be considered by examining organizational bias. This relates to the values\\nand preferences that characterize the organization and its culture. According to the Agile\\nPractice Guide, the biases include exploring versus executing, speed versus stability,\\nquality versus quantity, and flexibility versus predictability.\\n302 \\n141. C. Tailoring is often a way to address obstacles and blockers for teams looking to adopt\\nmore Agile practices. When Agile terms and language do not fit the organizational norms,\\none way to overcome it is by modifying the terms so that team members understand and\\nagree to the activities. To be successful, teams should clearly define terms in order to align\\nwith the meaning.\\n142. A. Low-priority risks are added to a watch list within the risk register, where they will be\\nmonitored for possible changes.\\n143. C. The schedule management plan documents the method and approach for developing,\\nmanaging, and controlling the project schedule.\\n144. C. Jenny used the directing conflict resolution technique, also known as forcing. Directing\\nis where one pushes their own viewpoint at the expense of others. In this scenario, Jenny\\ndid not fully acknowledge or recognize Bob’s concerns and opinions about user story #2.\\nThis is considered to be a win-lose situation.\\n145. B. Cost variance tells you whether costs are above or below what was planned for this\\nperiod and are calculated by subtracting AC from EV. In this case, the formula looks like\\nthis: $95 – $100 = –$5. The resulting number is negative, which means the project costs\\nare lower than what was planned for this time period.\\n146. D. The business analyst and the project manager have carried out activities relating to\\nthe following processes: Collect Requirements, Define Scope, and Create WBS. These\\nprocesses belong to the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area. Project Requirements\\nManagement is not an official Knowledge Area.\\n147. B, C, D. Project governance frameworks address governance at the project versus\\norganizational level. According to the PMBOK® Guide, project governance is the\\nframework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities to create a\\nunique product, service, or result to meet intended goals.\\n148. D. The team charter is also referred to as the team’s social contract. In addition to ground\\nrules, this agreement captures team values, working agreements, and group norms.\\nIdeally, the team formulates this together.\\n149. C. All of the options listed are benefits of using virtual teams. In this scenario, the team is\\nlacking in the technical knowledge required to complete the set of features. Broadening the\\nresource pool to include virtual team members increases the likelihood that the right skill\\nset will be acquired.\\n150. B. This question references the Manage Communications process, which is responsible\\nfor ensuring the timely distribution of project information. Project management plan,\\nproject documents, work performance reports, enterprise environmental factors, and\\norganizational process assets are all inputs of the process. The remaining options\\npresented are tools and techniques of the process, not inputs.\\n151. B. Schedule network analysis is a tool and technique of the Develop Schedule process\\nthat’s used in conjunction with other tools and techniques, including the critical path\\nmethod, to produce the project schedule.\\n152. A-1, B-2, C-2, D-1, E-1. The resource management plan captures how resources will be\\ncategorized, allocated, managed, and released. The team charter captures and documents\\nthe guidelines for how the team will operate together, and it also captures the team values\\nand agreements.\\n153. B. The risk report contains a summary of identified project risks and sources of overall\\nproject risk.\\n154. A. Change control systems are a subset of the configuration management system.\\nConfiguration management systems are a subset of the project management information\\nsystem.\\n155. D. The final report is created as a result of carrying out activities associated with the\\nClose Project or Phase process. This project artifact summarizes the performance of\\nthe project or phase and generally captures the following: summary description of the\\nproject or phase, performance against scope/quality/cost/schedule objectives, summary of\\nvalidation information about the work completed, summary of risks or issues encountered,\\nand summary of whether the end result produced by the project satisfies the business\\nneeds that the project was addressing.\\n156. E. The role of project manager within Agile practices continues to be debated. According\\nto the Agile Practice Guide, the project manager role is sometimes called a team\\nfacilitator, team coach, Scrum master, or project team lead.\\n157. A, D. The adoption of Agile practices begins by embracing an Agile mindset. According\\nto the Agile Practice Guide, project teams looking to adopt Agile can ask themselves the\\nfollowing questions while developing an implementation strategy: How can the project\\nteam act in an Agile manner? What can the team deliver quickly and obtain early feedback\\nabout to benefit the next delivery cycle? How can the team act in a transparent manner?\\nWhat work can be avoided in order to focus on high-priority items? How can a servant-\\nleadership approach benefit the achievement of the team’s goals?\\n158. A, C, D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, a servant leader maintains the following\\ncharacteristics: promote self-awareness; listen; serve those on the team; help others grow;\\ncoach versus control; promote safety, respect, and trust; and promote the energy and\\nintelligence of others. This type of style is often used in environments that have adopted\\nAgile practices.\\n159. B. Common causes of variances are the result of random variances, known or predictable\\nvariances, or variances that are always present in the process.\\n160. C. The formula for ETC when variances are expected to continue is ETC = (BAC – EV) ÷\\nCPI. First you need to calculate CPI, which is $925 ÷ $925 = $1. Now you can plug in the\\nnumbers: ($1,400 – $925) ÷ 1 = $475.\\n161. A, C, D. Conflict management, decision-making, emotional intelligence, influencing, and\\nleadership are all examples of interpersonal and team skills that a project manager should\\nuse to manage a team.\\n304 \\n162. B. According to the Agile Practice Guide, the burndown chart refers to a graphical\\nrepresentation of the work remaining versus the time left in a timebox.\\n163. D. Inspection may involve a simple or physical review of the work performed by a\\ncontractor. It is structured in nature and is meant to ensure that a mutual understanding\\nexists of the work in progress.\\n164. A. Deliverables are an input, not an output, of the Manage Project Knowledge process.\\nThe remaining options all represent outputs of the process.\\n165. B. Generally, Agile practices create a culture of transparency. Participating in peer-coding\\nactivities, sharing interim deliverables, and revealing failures can be intimidating and\\nfrightening for some team members who prefer to perfect their work before releasing it. In\\nthis situation, the best approach is to lead by example and demonstrate transparency when\\nmaking decisions. This will eventually create a feeling of safety and comfort.\\n166. B. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the change log is a comprehensive list of changes\\nsubmitted during the project and their current status. It captures corrective actions,\\npreventive actions, or defect repair needed. The change log becomes a key document\\nmanaged as part of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, where change\\nrequests are reviewed and a decision on the request is made.\\n167. C. The Tuckman ladder, also referred to as stages of team development, consists of\\nfive stages that teams may go through: forming, storming, norming, performing, and\\nadjourning. In the forming phase, team members do not know each other well and are\\nlearning about the project and their roles.\\n168. E. There are several technical practices that can help teams deliver at maximum speed,\\nseveral of which come from eXtreme Programming. Examples include continuous\\nintegration, test at all levels, acceptance test-driven development, test-driven development\\nand behavior-driven development, and spikes.\\n169. D. The communications management plan describes how communication throughout the\\nproject will be planned, structured, implemented, and monitored for effectiveness. It is a\\ncomponent of the broader project management plan. One of the elements captured within\\nthe communications management plan includes the escalation processes.\\n170. A. Stakeholders have the greatest amount of influence during the early stages of a project’s\\nlife cycle.\\n171. A-4, B-1, C-2, D-3. Project managers and other leaders use power to convince others\\nto do tasks in a specific way. The kind of power used depends on their personality, their\\npersonal values, and the company culture.\\n172. D. Earned value management is a performance measurement method. Forecasting is not\\na performance measurement method. Variance analysis and trend analysis are types of\\nperformance review.\\n173. B. The team is engaged in backlog refinement activities. This encompasses working with the\\nteam to prepare stories for the upcoming iteration. Stories should contain sufficient detail for\\nthe team to understand the scope of work and how large they are in relation to each other.\\n174. B, C. The team charter captures and documents the guidelines for how the team will\\noperate together, and it also captures the team values and agreements. Examples of\\nelements addressed in the team charter include team values, communication guidelines,\\ndecision-making criteria and process, conflict resolution process, meeting guidelines, and\\nteam agreements. The roles and responsibilities and process for acquiring team members\\nare captured within the resource management plan.\\n175. A, B. A highly predictive (waterfall) life cycle typically has detailed specifications, with\\nrequirements defined up front before work begins. A highly adaptive life cycle (Agile) has\\nrequirements that are progressively elaborated on, and delivery occurs frequently. Change\\nwithin a predictive life cycle is constrained, while adaptive encourages change to be\\nincorporated in real time during delivery.\\n176. D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, team members who are not dedicated to an\\nAgile team and who must context switch between tasks lose on average 20 percent to 40\\npercent productivity.\\n177. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, corrective action is an intentional activity that\\nrealigns the performance of the project work with the project management plan; in other\\nwords, it’s work that brings the project back in line with the plan.\\n178. C. The lessons learned register is typically created early on within the project’s life and\\nupdated at various points throughout the project (i.e., end of a phase). At the end of the\\nproject, a final lessons learned session is held to capture information, which will then be\\narchived for future reference.\\n179. C. Colocation brings team members together in one physical location for the duration of\\nthe project or for critical points during the project life cycle. A war room is an example of\\ncolocation where team members work in a common meeting room.\\n180. A. This question lists all the outputs of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. The\\nissue log is used more like an action item log in this process.\\n181. A. The Tuckman ladder, also referred to as stages of team development, consists of\\nfive stages that teams may go through: forming, storming, norming, performing, and\\nadjourning. In the norming stage, the team members have come to know each other well\\nand are focused on confronting project concerns versus each other.\\n182. B, C, D. Burnup charts, burndown charts, lead time, and cycle time provide useful\\nin-the-moment measurements, providing insight into capacity measures and predictability\\nmeasures. These types of measurements can provide the team with an understanding of\\nhow much more work they have and whether they will finish on time.\\n306 \\n183. A, C. In this scenario, you are using the eXtreme Programming (XP) approach, which is\\nan adaptive approach to managing projects. XP delivers business value in each iteration\\nand starts with creating story cards. Story cards are like user stories and contain\\nrequirements, features, and functionality. The story cards are designed in an incremental\\nfashion. Pair programming involves two developers working on code together.\\n184. A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2, E-5. There are several motivational theories developed by well-known\\ntheorists who explain how individuals are motivated and why they may feel or behave in\\ncertain ways.\\n185. A. The risk register contains the list of risks captured and information about them, such\\nas risk owners, risk triggers, risk response plans.\\n186. C. Adaptive life cycles are also known as Agile or change-driven life cycles.\\n187. D. Osmotic communication is a form of polite eavesdropping and is used within the\\nCrystal methodology. It occurs when there are conversations going on in the background\\nbut within earshot of the team. Team members overhear conversations and may realize the\\ntopic has importance to the project.\\n188. B. Variance at completion is calculated this way: BAC − EAC.\\n189. E. Inbound competencies refer to self-management and self-awareness, while outbound\\ncompetencies refer to relationship management.\\n190. B. The minimum viable product (MVP) is used to increase the speed of delivery and\\nobtain feedback on a product early. The product contains just enough features or\\ndeliverables to obtain feedback; this feedback can then be used for future incremental\\ndevelopment of the product.\\n191. A, C, D. The incremental life cycle approach delivers completed functionality or\\ndeliverables at the end of the iteration that the product owner can use immediately. The\\nsponsors or customers are therefore able to gain value more often rather than waiting until\\nthe end of the project. This approach is optimized for speed of delivery, releasing a subset\\nof the overall solution as a way of gaining feedback and a better understanding of the\\nrequirements.\\n192. A-3, B-2, C-1, D-5, E-4. The Five-Factor Model, also known as the Big Five personality\\ntraits, is a personality survey that identifies five broad dimensions used to describe an\\nindividual’s personality. The five factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness,\\nextraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.\\n193. D. A charismatic leader is someone who leads by inspiring followers; they create high\\nenergy around them and tend to hold strong convictions.\\n194. A. There are three common roles used in Agile teams: cross-functional team member,\\nproduct owner, and team facilitator.\\nChapter 6: Full-Length Practice Exam 3 307\\n195. B. According to the Agile Practice Guide, definition of done (DoD) refers to a team’s\\nchecklist of all the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready\\nfor customer use. Acceptance criteria refers to a set of conditions that must be met before\\ndeliverables are accepted.\\n196. B. The minimum viable product (MVP) is used to increase the speed of delivery and\\nobtain feedback of a product early. MVP can satisfy early adopters by making a version of\\nthe product available and then use the feedback for future incremental development of the\\nproduct.\\n197. A. Agile promotes frequent and transparent communication, particularly when the project\\nenvironment is subject to ambiguity and/or change. This concept applies to the handling\\nof project artifacts as well. According to the Agile Practice Guide, project artifacts should\\nbe posted in a transparent manner, with regular stakeholder reviews held to promote\\ncommunication among stakeholders.\\n198. D. Configuration status accounting is an activity that is associated with the configuration\\nmanagement system. This activity documents and stores the status of changes and the\\ninformation needed to effectively manage product information.\\n199. D. Within Agile there is a concept that describes the degree to which individuals can\\ntake on work, according to their depth and breadth. “T” shaped people are considered\\ngeneralizing specialists who have expertise in an area but can also contribute to other\\nareas. “I” shaped people refers to those who have deep specialization in one domain and\\nrarely contribute to work outside of that domain.\\n200.

       "'\\n195. B. According to the Agile Practice Guide, definition of done (DoD) refers to a team’s\\nchecklist of all the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready\\nfor customer use. Acceptance criteria refers to a set of conditions that must be met before\\ndeliverables are accepted.\\n196. B. The minimum viable product (MVP) is used to increase the speed of delivery and\\nobtain feedback of a product early. MVP can satisfy early adopters by making a version of\\nthe product available and then use the feedback for future incremental development of the\\nproduct.\\n197. A. Agile promotes frequent and transparent communication, particularly when the project\\nenvironment is subject to ambiguity and/or change. This concept applies to the handling\\nof project artifacts as well. According to the Agile Practice Guide, project artifacts should\\nbe posted in a transparent manner, with regular stakeholder reviews held to promote\\ncommunication among stakeholders.\\n198. D. Configuration status accounting is an activity that is associated with the configuration\\nmanagement system. This activity documents and stores the status of changes and the\\ninformation needed to effectively manage product information.\\n199. D. Within Agile there is a concept that describes the degree to which individuals can\\ntake on work, according to their depth and breadth. “T” shaped people are considered\\ngeneralizing specialists who have expertise in an area but can also contribute to other\\nareas. “I” shaped people refers to those who have deep specialization in one domain and\\nrarely contribute to work outside of that domain.\\n200. B. Data analysis is the only tool and technique of the Control Scope process.\\nChapter 6: Full-Length Practice Exam 3\\n1. B. Expected value can be calculated using a triangular distribution (simple average) or\\nbeta distribution (weighted average). The three-point estimating formula that uses a beta\\ndistribution is as follows: (Optimistic + Pessimistic + (4 × Most Likely)) ÷ 6. Plug in the\\nvalues provided to calculate the following: ($25 + $50 + ($35 × 4)) ÷ 6 = $35.8, or 36 when\\nrounded to the nearest whole number.\\n2. D. Iterative life cycles focus on correctness of solution. For this reason, stakeholder\\nfeedback is obtained early and often, such as through prototypes, so that changes can be\\nincorporated into the solution based on feedback and insights received.\\n3. A. The Expectancy Theory states that employees who believe that more effort will lead\\nto better performance, which will then lead to rewards that they personally value, will\\ncontinue to be productive. This is a conscious choice; otherwise, if they don’t value the\\nrewards, their incentive to be productive is lost.\\n308 \\n4. B. Outputs of the Define Activities process include the activity list, activity attributers,\\nmilestone list, change requests, and project management plan updates. The question has\\nalready indicated that the activity list has already been created, and the milestone list is\\nthe only viable option.\\n5. C. Team-building activities increase team collaboration and social relationships, as\\nwell as foster a cooperative working environment. A team benefits from continuous\\nteam-building activities throughout the life of the project; it is particularly important\\nduring the early stages of a project, when relationships among team members are not yet\\ndeveloped.\\n6. C. The Determine Budget process establishes the cost baseline for the project and is an\\noutput of this process.\\n7. B. All of the options listed are types of communication. When dealing with complex\\nissues, it is best to use a written format that is formal. Formal written is also the best\\nchoice when working with other cultures, communicating over long distances, updating a\\nplan, or dealing with legal matters.\\n8. B. While the risk management plan covers the details of risk-related reports and formats,\\nit does not cover all of the communication requirements of project stakeholders. This is\\naddressed within the communications management plan.\\n9. A. While several benefits to virtual teams are included within the various options, this\\nparticular project requires a specialized skill set. Since virtual teams widen the resource\\npool available, with team members potentially located across the globe, it allows for this\\nunique resource need to be met. Without the use of virtual teams, the project may not\\nhave been possible, or it may have been very costly due to relocating team members or\\nfrequent travel.\\n10. A, B, D. Daily stand-ups encourage the team to remain self-organized and hold each other\\naccountable for completing work that they have committed to. Whereas iteration-based\\nAgile focuses on accountability, flow-based Agile focuses on the team’s throughput.\\n11. C. Philip Crosby believed that quality is achieved when zero defects are present, and if\\na defect is present and considered acceptable, then the requirements should be altered to\\nreflect this fact.\\n12. A, C. Knowledge can be split into explicit and tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge can\\nbe captured and expressed using words, pictures, and numbers; tacit knowledge is more\\ndifficult to capture or express, such as beliefs, experiences, and “know-how.”\\n13. D. Level of accuracy describes your rounding precision, and units of measure describes\\nhow you will measure resources, for example, days, weeks, months.\\n14. D. You are currently performing activities associated with the Control Schedule process,\\nwhich is part of the Monitoring and Controlling process group.\\n15. B, C, D. There are various Agile suitability filters and/or models available that help\\ndetermine whether an organization would benefit from adopting Agile approaches. A\\nbroad model presented within the Agile Practice Guide assesses organizations against\\nthree categories: culture (i.e., does the environment support the approach?), team (i.e., is\\nthe team of a suitable size?), and project (i.e., are there high rates of change?).\\n16. C. Internal rate of return is when the present value of the cash inflows equals the original\\ninvestment; payback period refers to the number of periods (in this case months) that\\nmust pass before the initial investment is recouped. While both Project X and Project\\nRevolution have an IRR of 3 percent, project revolution has a shorter payback period.\\n17. C. Transformational is a form of leadership style where the leader encourages the ideas of\\nothers, innovation, and creativity.\\n18. B. The WBS serves as the basis for estimating costs. It is an input to the Estimate Costs\\nprocess through the scope baseline, which is part of the project management plan. It\\ncontains all the project deliverables and the control accounts associated with work\\npackage elements.\\n19. A, D. While Agile teams vary, typical characteristics include the following: they range\\nin size from three to nine team members, they are colocated, and they are 100 percent\\ndedicated to the team.\\n20. B. The Five-Factor Model, also known as the Big Five personality traits, is a personality\\nsurvey that identifies five broad dimensions used to describe an individual’s personality.\\nThe five factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness,\\nand neuroticism. The conscientiousness domain measures where individuals fall on the\\nspectrum of efficient versus careless.\\n21. A. Prototypes allow for early feedback on the requirements for further refinement and\\nclarification. They are a technique used as part of the Collect Requirements process.\\n22. D. You are carrying out the Create WBS process. The purpose of the process is to\\nsubdivide the project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable\\ncomponents.\\n23. B. Kanban is an agile approach that is often used in manufacturing projects but also\\nmakes a presence in the information technology field. Using Kanban, the work is balanced\\nagainst available resources or available capacity for work. It’s a pull-based concept where\\nwork progresses to the next step only when resources are available.\\n24. C. The formula for calculating expected monetary value is probability times impact. Plug\\nin the values to get the following: 10% × $4,000 = $400.\\n25. A-1, B-5, C-3, D-2, E-4. There are several Agile-based approaches that follow iterative or\\nflow-based Agile methods. In addition to the various flavors of Agile, hybrid approaches\\nalso exist, such as Scrumban (a combination of Kanban and Scrum).\\n310 \\n26. B. The Determine Budget process yields the cost baseline, project funding requirements,\\nand updates to project documents. The project funding requirements represent the total\\nfunding requirements and periodic funding requirements of the project.\\n27. A, B, D. The organizational breakdown structure, bill of materials, risk breakdown\\nstructure, and resource breakdown structure all present project information in a\\nhierarchical fashion. The resource assignment matrix does not.\\n28. B. The quality management plan may describe measurements that fall within a specified\\nrange. These are called tolerable results.\\n29. B. The project manager has told the scheduler that the schedule must be compressed\\nby one week. That means that we will use one of two schedule compression techniques:\\ncrashing or fast-tracking, both of which are options. When possible, select the lowest-cost\\noption first, which would be fast-tracking.\\n30. B. If the team maintains a velocity of 60 story points per iteration, it would take seven\\niterations to complete the remaining 420 story points.\\n31. A, B, C. Servant leaders engage the team and take on a selfless view by serving others. They\\ndo this by approaching their work in the following order: purpose, people, and process.\\n32. C. Cost baselines and schedule baselines are used to measure performance in the\\nExecuting and Monitoring and Controlling processes.\\n33. A, B, C. The probability and impact matrix is not an input to the Perform Quantitative\\nRisk Analysis process. It is used to prioritize risks, it’s defined in the risk management\\nplan, and it’s used as a tool and technique in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis\\nprocess.\\n34. C. The correct answer is that inspection keeps errors from reaching the customer, while\\nprevention prevents errors from occurring.\\n35. D. A burndown chart is used to track the remaining work to be completed against the\\nbacklog. It shows work completed to date by iteration and the forecasted rate at which\\nthe team will complete the remaining work over the remaining iterations, based on\\nvelocity.\\n36. B. Requirements are documented through user stories that make up the backlog. The user\\nstories are then prioritized and refined.\\n37. C. The project budget includes the cost baseline. Option C has it backward.\\n38. C. To calculate the critical path, you must first draw out the network diagram and\\nthen add the duration of each activity that falls within the individual network paths.\\nFigure 6.1 shows the network diagram and the three network paths that exist within it.\\nThe following is the duration of each of those paths: A-B-D-F = 17, A-C-D-F = 19, A-C-\\nE-F = 21.\\nFigurE 6.1 Network diagram: critical path\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\nFloat: Float:\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\nFloat: 2 4 Float:\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 6\\nFloat: Float:\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n4 6\\n39. C. To calculate the early finish of activity D, you would first need to perform a forward\\npass. To calculate forward pass, draw the network diagram and then follow these steps:\\n1. Begin with the first activity.\\n2. The calculation of the first activity begins with an early start date of 1. Add the\\nduration of the activity and then subtract 1 to determine the early finish. This is based\\non the concept of calendar days.\\n3. The early start date of the next activity is the early finish date of the previous activity\\nplus 1. Continue calculating the early start and early finish dates forward through all\\nthe network paths while following the existing dependencies.\\n4. When an activity has two connecting predecessors, the early start date would be the\\nearly finish of the predecessor that finishes last, plus 1.\\nFigure 6.2 shows the network diagram with early start and early finish dates calculated.\\nFigurE 6.2 Network diagram: forward pass\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n6 Float: 7 10 Float: 13\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n1 Float: 5 2 4 16 Float: 21\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 6\\n6 Float: 9 10 Float: 15\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n4 6\\n40. A. To calculate the late start of activity C, you would first need to perform a forward\\npass and a backward pass. To calculate backward pass, draw the network diagram and\\nperform a forward pass and then follow these steps:\\n1. Begin with the last activity. The late finish will be the same as the early finish date.\\n2. Subtract the duration of the activity from the end date and add 1 to calculate late\\nstart. Take this number and subtract 1 to calculate the late finish of its predecessors.\\n312 \\n3. Continue calculating the latest start and latest finish dates, moving backward through\\nall the network paths.\\n4. When an activity has two connecting predecessors, the late finish date would be the\\nlate start minus 1 of the activity that follows.\\nFigure 6.3 shows the network diagram with early start and early finish dates calculated.\\nFigurE 6.3 Network diagram: backward pass\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n6 Float: 7 10 Float: 13\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n1 Float: 5 8 2 9 12 4 15 16 Float: 21\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n1 5 5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 16 6 21\\n6 Float: 9 10 Float: 15\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n6 4 9 10 6 15\\n41. A. Total float refers to the amount of time you can delay the earliest start of an activity\\nwithout delaying the ending of the project. To calculate total float, you would first need to\\ndraw the network diagram and then perform a forward pass and a backward pass. Next,\\nsubtract either the early start from the late start or the early finish from the late finish\\n(both should give you the same answer). Figure 6.4 shows the network diagram with total\\nfloat calculated.\\nFigurE 6.4 Network diagram: float\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n6 Float: 2 7 10 Float: 2 13\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n1 Float: 0 5 8 2 9 12 4 15 16 Float: 0 21\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n1 5 5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 16 6 21\\n6 Float: 0 9 10 Float: 0 15\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n6 4 9 10 6 15\\n42. A, B, D. Agile PMOs guide the organization in achieving business value. There are\\nmultiple types of PMOs; an Agile PMO is value-driven, invitation-oriented, and\\nmultidisciplinary.\\n43. A. Resource leveling involves leveling out resource usage to resolve over-allocation of\\nresources and/or to level out the peaks and valleys of resource usage over time.\\n44. D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, the role of a servant leader is to facilitate the\\nteam’s discovery and definition of Agile.\\n45. B. The analogous estimating technique is a form of expert judgment, which uses the\\nactual duration of a similar activity completed on a previous project to determine the\\nduration of the current activity. This means that Alyssa would rely on feedback from the\\nsubject-matter expert who noted that in a past similar project it took 13 hours to complete\\na similar activity.\\n46. A, C, D. The Plan Procurement Management process can influence the project schedule\\n(and vice versa). The Estimate Activity Resources process, make-or-buy decisions, and the\\norganization’s business cycle may have an impact on the Plan Procurement Management\\nprocess.\\n47. C. Based on the activities Marysil has already carried out, the next logical step would\\nbe to begin implementing the risk responses based on plans documented in the risk\\nregister. While some risk responses are implemented when risk triggers occur, others are\\nimplemented immediately to avoid or exploit a risk.\\n48. C. Based on the performance indexes provided, the project is 10 percent ahead of\\nschedule but over budget. Leveling out resource usage is a strategy used to spread out\\ncosts over time. This helps in reducing sudden spikes in spending, although it may lead to\\nlengthening the schedule.\\n49. A, C, D. There are four primary events used by Scrum teams: sprint planning, daily\\nscrum (versus weekly), sprint review, and sprint retrospective.\\n50. D. Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the\\nquantity of work by the rate or uses an algorithm in conjunction with historical data to\\ndetermine cost, budget, or duration estimates. Based on this definition, take 1,320 and\\ndivide by 110 to get 12.\\n51. C. The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is the projected cost performance the\\nremaining work of the project must achieve in order to meet the BAC or EAC.\\n52. C. There are five types of power that a project manager can utilize. These include formal,\\nreward, penalty, expert, and referent. The question asks for the one that is based on the\\nrespect or admiration that others hold for an individual, which is referent power.\\n53. B, C, D. Only the Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM) uses dummy activities, which are\\nnot real activities but instead are meant to show that a relationship between two activities\\nexists. All other statements are accurate.\\n54. A, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are four common project life cycles:\\npredictive, iterative, incremental, and Agile. Hybrid refers to a combination of two or\\nmore life cycles.\\n55. D. The project charter is generated at the start of a project. Before we can move forward\\nin planning or building out the backlog of the project, there is one key activity that a\\nproject manager should perform at the start of a project—building out the stakeholder\\nregister. This is created as a result of performing stakeholder analysis.\\n314 \\n56. C. A CPI of greater than 1 is performing under budget; an SPI of less than 1 is performing\\nbehind schedule. Remember that generally an index > 1 is good, an index = 1 is perfect,\\nand an index of < 1 is bad.\\n57. B. Independent peer review is the correct answer. This type of review ensures that the\\nconcepts, the designs, and the tests that are utilized at the beginning of the project were\\ngood choices.\\n58. A. Agile teams often create a team charter as a way of creating a social contract for the\\nteam. The team charter identifies team norms and an understanding of how the team is\\nto work together. This social contract captures team values, working agreements, ground\\nrules, and group norms.\\n59. F. Servant leaders enable teams to be more Agile and play the important role of facilitating\\nthe team’s success. According to the Agile Practice Guide, characteristics of a servant\\nleader include promoting self-awareness, listening, serving the team, helping others grow,\\ncoaching versus controlling, promoting safety/respect/trust, and promoting the energy and\\nintelligence of others.\\n60. C. The matrix diagrams tool includes two-dimensional and three-dimensional diagrams.\\nIt is a part of the data representation tools and techniques of the Manage Quality process.\\n61. C. Halo effect is when a person’s strong traits are perceived as an indication of another\\ntrait. In this example, it is thought that because Jon is good at his job, he must therefore be a\\ngood project manager. But the job of a research technician has different required skills than\\nthe job of a project manager. The most common example given is that an attractive person,\\nsuch as a celebrity, must be intelligent, which is why they are often used in advertising.\\n62. D. At this point, pre-assignments is a technique already used, and the issue is that a\\nkey resource was not pre-assigned and is now unavailable. The best option would be to\\nnegotiate with the project managers of the other two projects, along with the resource’s\\nfunctional manager, to open up availability for participation in the project in question.\\nAcquisition may be a potential option, but not until negotiation has been attempted.\\n63. B. Specification limits and assignable cause are related to control charts and are therefore\\nnot the correct answers; trend analysis relates to run chart, also not the answer. That\\nleaves the 80/20 rule, also known as Pareto’s Law or the Pareto Principle, which states\\nthat 80 percent of problems result from 20 percent of causes. This is exactly what the\\nproject manager in this scenario is looking for.\\n64. A. Incremental life cycles focus on speed through frequent smaller deliveries. This\\nsupports a project with dynamic requirements that allow the project team to hand over\\ncompleted deliverables to the customer that can be used immediately. Other options refer\\nto predictive, iterative, and Agile life cycles.\\n65. B. Only “formal written” and “informal written” are communication types. Email can be\\nconsidered to be a formal or informal way of communicating, depending on the contents.\\nIn the context of the scenario presented, email is considered to be informal.\\n66. A, B, D. Risks on a watch list are low-priority risks that are determined to contain a\\nminimal amount of threat but that should be monitored regularly for a change of status as\\nthe project moves forward. All other statements are true.\\n67. B, E. While all options may have contributed to the project issues, a poorly written scope\\ncan quickly result in project failure, no matter how good the change control procedures or\\nsystems are. A lack of formal project management may have contributed as well but being\\ncertified does not guarantee that this type of scenario will not occur. The scope baseline\\nis often used for change control purposes and in making project decisions, which is why a\\npoorly written scope will result in a large number of project changes for projects managed\\nusing a predictive life-cycle approach. Given that the project contained high ambiguity,\\nissues may have been reduced by using an adaptive or hybrid life-cycle approach.\\n68. A. Negotiation is a common technique used by project managers to acquire resources\\nfor a project. Ideally, the project manager would have first approached the director of\\nengineering for approval, but at this stage, the best option was to attempt to negotiate\\nwith the resource’s manager. The project sponsor should not get involved in cases like this\\nunless it is detrimental to the project.\\n69. B. The best choice is to note the issue within the issue log. The reason for this is that an\\nowner can then be assigned to the issue, and a target resolution date set. This allows for\\nmore structured and documented resolution. The issue log is also something that will be\\narchived at a later date within the project files.\\n70. E. While retrospectives are often held at the conclusion of an iteration or increment,\\nteams can facilitate retrospectives at various key points in a project to gain benefits. This\\nincludes situations where the team does not feel that the work is flowing well. While teams\\nare not necessarily limited as to when retrospectives are held, they are typically used after\\nthe project work begins.\\n71. B. Observation and conversation is a technique from the Manage Team process and\\ndescribes a way for the project manager to monitor the team’s progress, accomplishments,\\nand interpersonal issues, and it is therefore the correct answer. 360-degree feedback is\\na type of project performance appraisal, where feedback is received from all levels of\\ninteraction with a team member. This provides information about a team member, but\\nnot from the team member themselves. Issue log tracks issues so is not relevant here,\\nand team-building activities seems like a good choice, except that the purpose is to grow\\nrelationships among the team, with a focus on establishing cohesiveness, not assessing\\nwork attitudes.\\n72. A. To solve a decision tree, calculate the expected monetary value of each scenario.\\nExpected monetary value can be calculated by multiplying the impact by the probability.\\nScenario A has a potential implication of –$1,250, and scenario B has a potential\\nimplication of –$2,275. Therefore, scenario A is the best choice.\\n73. D. Knowledge can be split into two types: explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge can be\\ncaptured and expressed using words, pictures, and numbers; tacit knowledge is more\\ndifficult to capture or express, such as beliefs, experiences, and “know-how.”\\n316 \\n74. D. The project manager is using the Stacey Complexity Model to plot the degree of\\ncertainty about the complexity elements, such as requirements, technical challenges, or\\nteam skills. The degrees are measured as low uncertainty or agreement to high uncertainty\\nor lack of agreement. Projects that fall within the complicated and complex quadrants are\\nbest suited for Adaptive approaches, while projects that fall within the simple quadrant\\nare best suited for predictive/linear approaches.\\n75. B. The project charter is typically signed off by the project’s sponsor, who is responsible\\nfor approving the project. In this case, Nicolas is identified as the sponsor and is therefore\\nthe correct answer.\\n76. B. The concept of continuous improvement centers around the idea that small or\\nincremental improvements within a product or process has the ability to reduce cost and\\nkeep consistency of performance. The word kaizen in Japan translates to “change for the\\nbetter.”\\n77. C. The question refers to a key input of the Direct and Manage Project Work process,\\nwhich is a process that provides overall management of the project work and deliverables.\\nWhile several inputs are important, without the approved change requests, you cannot\\ncomplete the activities referenced in the question.\\n78. B. A retrospective is similar to a lessons learned session in that the team learns from\\nprevious work. Retrospectives are a way for Agile teams to learn about and improve the\\nprocess. Oftentimes, teams will commit to improving one item during the next iteration.\\n79. D. Interpersonal skills are used by the project manager to build trust, resolve conflict,\\nactively listen to stakeholders, and overcome resistance to change. It is a technique used by\\nthe Manage Stakeholder Engagement, Develop Project Team, and Manage Project Team\\nprocesses.\\n80. D. A team charter is also referred to as a social contract. This document captures how\\nteam members are to interact with one another, including their ground rules, group\\nnorms, working agreements, and team values.\\n81. A. As a project manager, it is your responsibility to contribute to the project management\\nknowledge base, which includes educating others on project management practices.\\nIndependent estimates is a tool and technique of the Plan Procurement Management.\\n82. D. Data analysis is a tool and technique of the Estimate Costs process. There are several\\ntechniques that are part of data analysis, such as alternatives analysis. Other techniques\\ninclude reserve analysis and cost of quality.\\n83. A. To calculate CPI, use the following formula: CPI = EV ÷ AC. Plug in the values to\\ncalculate the following: 1,700 ÷ 1,950 = 0.87. A CPI of less than 1 means that the project\\nis performing over budget.\\n84. C. The transfer strategy involves the transfer of a risk to a third party. In this case, the\\nthird party manages and takes responsibility for the risk. Insurance is one example of risk\\ntransference.\\n85. C. Sensitivity analysis determines which risks have the most potential impact on the\\nproject and utilizes tornado diagrams. This type of diagram compares the importance of\\nvariables that have a high degree of uncertainty to the more stable variables.\\n86. A-5, B-2, C-1, D-3, E-4. There are five types of conflict resolution technique: withdraw/\\navoid, smooth/accommodate, compromise/reconcile, force/direct, collaborate/\\nproblem-solve.\\n87. C. This statement describes virtual teams. Virtual teams consist of individuals who\\nare dispersed across various locations and interact primarily through technology, such\\nas video conference, online, chat, telephone, etc. There is minimal to no face time.\\nColocation is the exact opposite, where team members are physically located in the same\\nplace.\\n88. B. The power/interest grid groups stakeholders based on their level of authority, a\\nreference to power, and, by level of concern, a reference to interest.\\n89. A. Kaylee has just performed the Implement Risk Responses process and is likely to carry\\nout activities associated with the Monitor Risks process next. Risk audits are a tool and\\ntechnique used to evaluate the effectiveness of risk responses that have been implemented,\\nand typically occur either through risk review meetings or through dedicated risk audit\\nmeetings.\\n90. A. The question is asking for the most common source of conflict. The correct answer is\\nscarce resources. The other common sources of conflict include scheduling priorities and\\npersonal work styles.\\n91. D. The project is not officially considered to be complete until the customer or buyer\\nsigns off. This is a mistake many companies make, which leaves the door open for further\\nrequests or conflict as to whether the project was really completed. Formal closure\\naddresses it directly by obtaining agreement from the customer that the deliverables and\\nscope have indeed been met.\\n92. E. The Agile Manifesto lists four values: individuals and interactions over processes and\\ntools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over\\ncontract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.\\n93. B, C, D. The resource management plan describes when and how resource requirements\\nwill be met. It addresses things such as staff acquisition, timetable of when the team will\\nbe acquired, release criteria, training needs, recognition and rewards, compliance, and\\nsafety. It doesn’t, however, define the roles and responsibilities, which is a separate output\\nof the human resource management planning process.\\n94. B. The communications management plan offers the who, what, where, why, and when of\\ncommunications and reporting. This plan should contain the detailed information of when\\nthe report in question is scheduled for distribution.\\n95. A. Noise is defined as anything that may interfere with getting or receiving the message\\n(such as static). Only noise and medium were official terms provided within the four\\noptions, according to the basic model of communication.\\n318 \\n96. B. Under organizational process assets, the project management team utilizes the\\npolicies, procedures, guidelines, and management systems that pertain to procurement.\\nIt’s important to understand how the company currently conducts procurement activities,\\nwhich will aid the project team in compiling a good procurement management plan.\\n97. C. All options provided are forms of probability distribution. The most commonly used\\nprobability distributions are beta distributions and triangular distributions. Since beta is\\nthe only one of the two included as an option, it is the best choice.\\n98. C. Cost-reimbursable, also known as cost plus, is a contract type where the buyer agrees\\nto pay the seller for all actual costs incurred in completing the work, plus an additional\\namount. Some cost plus contracts pay an additional fixed fee, while others pay an\\nadditional award fee or incentive fee. The buyer is the one with the highest risk, since they\\nmay have little control over the seller’s spending.\\n99. D. Templates are stored within the organizational process assets. When using templates\\nfrom previous similar projects, the project manager can create a consistency of results,\\nsuch as by using portions of activity lists or network diagrams, thereby making more\\nefficient use of their time. It also allows for improved results.\\n100. C. The project manager is using the Stacey Complexity Model to plot the degree of\\ncertainty about the complexity elements, such as requirements, technical challenges, or\\nteam skills. This model displays levels of uncertainty from low to high on both the x- and\\ny-axes, or it may show levels of uncertainty on the x-axis and agreement levels on the\\ny-axis. This two-dimensional model shows the progression of the certainty and agreement\\nof complexity elements, which are plotted into categories such as simple or chaotic.\\n101. D. A fishbowl window is a method of creating a shared virtual workspace to\\naccommodate team members who are dispersed across multiple locations. Individuals\\ncan join a live video stream at the start of their workday and close it out at the end of the\\nworkday. This method is intended to increase collaboration.\\n102. C. The sender, who initiated the communication, is the project team member; the receiver\\nof the information is the project manager.\\n103. D. Notice that Sally took in the facts and made a choice on the spot, without listening\\nto the two-team members or attempting to discuss the choices. This type of conflict\\nresolution technique is known as forcing, where one person makes a decision without\\ntaking into account others’ feedback. Forcing is also known as directing.\\n104. D. A RACI is a type of responsibility assignment matrix (RAM), and it stands for\\nresponsible, accountable, consult, and inform.\\n105. B. The answer is cost of conformance to requirements. While quality works toward\\npreventing rework and providing better customer satisfaction, these are results of\\nconforming to the project requirements.\\n106. B. Pre-assignments occur when individuals have been promised as part of a contract to\\na customer, or they have been assigned as early as the project charter. In either case, the\\nresource has officially been committed to the project.\\n107. D. The question provides examples of project management information systems, which\\nis a tool and technique of the Manage Communications process. Information systems are\\ntools used to facilitate communication.\\n108. F. Projects may follow different project life cycles, depending on the organization and\\nunique needs of the project. According to the PMBOK® Guide, typical projects can be\\nmapped to a generic project life-cycle structure: starting the project, organizing and\\npreparing, carrying out the work, and closing the project.\\n109. A. When managing a project, you should always be aware of the local laws affecting the\\nproject, as well as the political climate. By being aware of the political climate, the project\\nteam would have planned and taken preventive actions. The question is not necessarily\\nasking you how to avoid the rally but, instead, how to prevent it from affecting the\\nproject.\\n110. D. Gold plating is a term often tied to quality. It involves giving customers extras that\\nare not included in the project scope, meaning that it is a form of scope creep. This can\\ninclude things like extra features, increasing performance, and adjusting components.\\n111. C. There are four primary items that the process improvement plan contains: process\\nboundaries, process configuration, process metrics, and targets for improved performance.\\nTherefore, failure rate is the correct answer.\\n112. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the 100 percent rule refers to the work breakdown\\nstructure including all of the work of the project. The WBS therefore represents all of the\\nproduct and project work, which can be best described as the scope of the project.\\n113. D. Mitigation reduces the probability and/or the impact of a risk. Other options describe\\nthe transfer, avoid, and enhance strategies.\\n114. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, business value is defined as the net quantifiable\\nbenefit derived from a business endeavor. Benefits may be both tangible and intangible.\\n115. A. A fixed-price contract, also known as lump sum, is where the seller provides an\\nestimate for the work, negotiates with the buyer, and commits to doing the work at that\\nprice. The seller has the greatest risk, because if the estimate was not good, they may end\\nup with little to no profit.\\n116. C. The question is asking for the project team to get to all the possible causes. There are a\\nfew potential answers, but based on the question and options provided, a cause-and-effect\\ndiagram is the best choice. This is the diagram that resembles a fishbone and shows how\\nvarious factors can be connected to potential problems.\\n117. A. All of the options included are risk attitudes. The names of the risk attitudes are fairly\\ndescriptive, making them easy to understand at face value.\\n118. B. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consult, and inform. The chart identifies\\nAlfred as being responsible for the Research activity, making him the correct answer.\\nResponsible indicates who will be performing the work.\\n320 \\n119. C. A team performance assessment has a goal of increasing the team’s performance, while\\nproject performance appraisals are feedback given directly to project team members. Team\\nperformance assessments are an output of the Develop Project Team process.\\n120. F. A team charter serves as a type of social contract for the team. According to the Agile\\nPractice Guide, the team charter captures team values, working agreements, ground rules,\\nand group norms.\\n121. C. An influence/impact grid can be split into four quadrants, where stakeholders will be\\nplotted against according to their level of influence and impact. Stakeholders with low\\ninfluence/low impact are likely to be monitored; stakeholders with high influence/low\\nimpact will likely be kept satisfied; stakeholders with low influence/high impact are likely\\nto be kept informed; and stakeholders with high influence/high impact are likely to be\\nmanaged closely. Tony falls in the latter of the options stated.\\n122. C. This is a great example of where multiple options appear correct. For example, you\\ncan argue that option A is correct, since the description fits a project. However, the\\nbest answer is that it is a program. A program is defined as a group of related projects\\ncoordinated together. A portfolio also contains a group of projects that have been grouped\\nin such a way as to meet a specific and strategic business objective, but not necessarily\\nbecause the projects are related. Work package is incorrect, since it refers to a deliverable\\nwithin a work breakdown structure.\\n123. F. Cost of quality refers to any related costs resulting from carrying out quality activities.\\nThis is considered an investment of time, money, and resources, which technically all boils\\ndown to an investment of money. The correct choice is rework.\\n124. A, B, D. A run chart is a type of quality tool and therefore not a format you would use to\\ndisplay an organizational chart.\\n125. B. The project manager is responsible for providing project team members with the\\nappropriate level of training needed to perform the work.\\n126. B. Perquisites is another type of benefits offered; they are often called “perks,” making it\\nthe correct answer.\\n127. B. In a start-to-start relationship, the successor activity (activity B) must wait for its\\npredecessor (activity A) to start before it can start. Since both activities are beginning as\\nsoon as possible, we can assume that activity B will begin immediately after activity A\\nstarts. However, there is a lag of two days, meaning that activity B must wait two days to\\nstart after activity A has started. That means that from the moment that A starts, activity\\nB will not be completed until nine days have passed (just add the duration of the activity,\\nplus the two day lag). Since the activities overlap in this scenario, then the duration that\\nhas passed for both activities to finish will have been 10 days total.\\n128. D. The project manager should allow team members to resolve their own conflict.\\nHowever, when the issue escalates and requires the involvement of the project manager,\\nthe best method is to collaborate (or problem-solve) to resolve the issue. This is a\\nrecommended conflict resolution technique because it leads to a win-win situation.\\n129. A-5, B-1, C-3, D-2, E-4. A project manager may leverage various leadership styles to\\naccommodate various situations and organizational norms. There are five leadership\\nstyles referenced within the PMBOK® Guide: Laissez-faire, transactional, servant leader,\\ntransformational, charismatic, interactional. Agile teams favor servant leadership due to\\nits focus on team.\\n130. C. Based on the question, the VP is clearly a stakeholder of the project, which means\\nthat they were not previously identified. If all stakeholders have not been identified, this\\nmeans that all expectations, needs, and requirements have not been fully documented and\\nresolved, which can create major issues within the project.\\n131. B. The definition of a project, as defined by the PMBOK® Guide, is “a temporary\\nendeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.” What the question is\\ntesting is whether you recognize the difference between a project and operational work.\\nThe definition of operational work is work that is ongoing, repetitive, and meant to\\nsustain a business.\\n132. A. Minimum viable products (MVP) contain just enough features or deliverables to\\nobtain feedback; this feedback can then be used for future incremental development of the\\nproduct.\\n133. A. Rolling wave planning is where work in the near term is planned out in detail, while\\nwork in the future is planned out at higher levels of the WBS. While this is a form of\\nprogressive elaboration, rolling wave planning is a more specific choice. Progressive\\nelaboration and rolling wave planning are different from scope creep in that they are\\nplanned and controlled.\\n134. B. The correct response is to allow the audit to take place. Audits are not always planned,\\nand the purpose is to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of quality. Discovering\\nexisting inefficiencies will highly benefit the team. Audits are a win-win; even if sometimes\\nit feels like an inconvenience, the big picture must remain at the forefront.\\n135. D. Target benefits refer to the tangible and intangible business value to be gained by the\\nimplementation of the product, service, or result. They are typically documented within a\\nbenefits management plan that details how and when benefits will be achieved.\\n136. D. A benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of a project will be\\ndelivered. It captures the timeframe for realizing benefits, both during the project’s life\\nspan and during post-project closure.\\n137. D. Osmotic communication is a form of polite eavesdropping and is used within the\\nCrystal method. It occurs when there are conversations going on in the background but\\nare within earshot of the team. Team members overhear conversations and may realize the\\ntopic has importance to the project.\\n138. D. As the sender of the message, the project manager is responsible for confirming that\\nthe message was understood correctly and that the information was clear and complete. In\\nthis scenario, the project manager assumed that the message was understood.\\n322 \\n139. E. There are specific factors considered in the development of roles and responsibilities.\\nThey are organizational, technical, interpersonal, logistical, and political.\\n140. C. Procurement audits are structured reviews that audit the procurement management\\nprocesses. The idea is to pinpoint what the efficiencies and inefficiencies were within the\\nprocurement management processes, which will be documented as part of the lessons\\nlearned. This information is important for future procurements, whether for the current\\nproject or future projects.\\n141. C. The correct answer is forcing, which is a type of conflict resolution technique, not\\na leadership style. There are six primary leadership styles: laissez-faire, transactional,\\nservant leader, transformational, charismatic, and interactional.\\n142. A. The accuracy level of One Sigma is 68.27 percent.\\n143. A. The EAC formula for this question is BAC ÷ CPI. First, calculate CPI, which is EV ÷\\nAC: 145 ÷ 138 = 1.05. Plugging in the numbers from the question, you get 200 ÷ 1.05 =\\n190.\\n144. A. Brainstorming is when individuals are brought together to generate and collect ideas\\non a variety of topics, such as requirements.\\n145. D. Kanban is based on lean-thinking principles and helps the team stay organized; it keeps\\nteam members collaborating and everyone informed. A flow-based agile approach such as\\nKanban pulls work from the backlog according to the team’s capacity to perform the work.\\n146. C. The project manager applies general management skills to coordinate and harmonize\\nthe group of stakeholders toward accomplishing the project objectives. General\\nmanagement skills is a technique of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process.\\n147. D. The Agile Manifesto identifies 12 principles that describe the Agile approach. It came\\nabout through a group of software developers who came together in 2001 to formalize the\\nAgile approach.\\n148. D. The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate when the present value of the cash\\ninflows equals the original investment. If basing project selection on the IRR, choose the\\nproject with a higher IRR value.\\n149. C. Colocation refers to team members working out of the same location physically.\\nCreating a war room is a method of colocation.\\n150. A. Virtual teams are team members located outside of the physical office where the\\nproject is primarily taking place.\\n151. D. It’s clear that the project manager did not check the resource calendars when creating\\nthe schedule. Resource calendars contain working and nonworking days of resources. This\\nincludes holidays, vacations, and when resources are idle.\\n152. D. Team-building activities build trust among the project team, allowing them to work in\\na more efficient and cohesive manner.\\n153. D. This refers to a milestone list that contains all the project’s milestones. It also notes\\nwhether a milestone is optional or mandatory. A milestone is a significant point or event in\\nthe project, and as the project progresses and the work is underway, the milestone list can\\nbe used as a benchmark to measure progress.\\n154. B. The correct answer is continuous improvement. The word kaizen means to change for\\nthe better in Japanese.\\n155. A. It is impossible, and sometimes inefficient, to plan out a project to perfection. There\\nare too many moving parts and factors, regardless of the similarity that projects may\\nhave to others managed in the past. A good project manager understands that change\\nis inevitable, which is why project maintenance, varying project life cycles, and overall\\nproject management is so important.\\n156. D. In this question, you’re taken to the Plan Human Resource Management process. What\\nSue is doing is adding value to the project. Networking is a form of informal interaction\\nwith others as a way of understanding political and interpersonal factors that impact\\nthe project and developing industry relationships and partnerships (if done within the\\ncompany, it would be building of relationships and partnerships internally).\\n157. B. The stakeholder management plan, which is created out of the Plan Stakeholder\\nManagement process, identifies the strategies needed to effectively engage stakeholders.\\nThe plan is based on the stakeholder analysis completed as part of creating the stakeholder\\nregister. While the project management plan is also technically correct, it is not the best\\nanswer as a more specific option was available.\\n158. A-4, B-3, C-1, D-2. The Crystal method is actually a family of methodologies that\\nare designed to scale to the project needs. It examines three factors to determine which\\nCrystal methodology to use: criticality of the project, priority of the project, and number\\nof people involved.\\n159. D. The top three sources of conflict include scarce resources, scheduling priorities, and\\npersonal work styles.\\n160. B. Cost-reimbursable contracts are a higher risk to the buyer. This is because the buyer\\nreimburses the seller for the seller’s actual cost, plus an additional amount, and depending\\non the type of cost-reimbursable contract will determine whether this additional fee is\\ncapped. For this reason, this contract is typically used when the buyer can describe the\\nwork but not how to go about the work.\\n161. D. Organizational process assets contain historical information from past archived\\nprojects, lessons learned, templates, policies, procedures, and other valuable information.\\nIn this case, the project manager is using a previous schedule management plan as a\\ntemplate and tailoring it for use by the current project. This is recommended practice and\\nprevents having to re-invent the wheel for every project. Instead, the effort is placed on\\nincreasing the efficiency and refining existing practices and templates.\\n162. A. The lowest level of the WBS is the work package level. The next step from there would\\nbe to decompose the work packages into the activity lists. The activity list, however, is not\\nconsidered to be part of the WBS itself. Planning packages and control accounts are placed\\nwithin the WBS but are not the lowest levels.\\n324 \\n163. C. Alfred is using an information management system, which captures, stores, and\\ndistributes information to stakeholders of the project.\\n164. A. At the beginning of a project ambiguity is at its peak. Stakeholders have a great deal\\nof input into this. As the project progresses and work is underway, the cost of change\\nincreases and the volume of change begins to decrease. As this is the case, stakeholders\\nare most likely to get their requests for inclusion and changes approved during the initial\\nphase of the project.\\n165. C. The question is referring to pre-assignments, which can be negotiated within the\\ncontract, can be included in the project charter, or can be a result of a project that revolves\\naround a staff member’s expertise. Pre-assignments is used as a tool and technique of the\\nAcquire Team process.\\n166. A. This question involves applying the communication channels formula, which is:\\nn (n – 1) ÷ 2. Plugging 24 in place of the n results in 276.\\n167. C. The PMBOK® Guide defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,\\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives. A workaround is put into action\\nfor an unidentified negative risk that has occurred. An issue can be described as a negative\\nrisk or event that is occurring in the present. A trigger, or risk trigger, is an event that\\nsignifies a risk is about to materialize.\\n168. C. Notice that the constraint impacts the sequence of events of the project, since the\\nproject manager must work around the deadline of providing the necessary parts before\\nthe vendor can begin, based on a contractual requirement. Dependencies that result from a\\nphysical or contractual requirement are known as mandatory dependencies, or hard logic.\\n169. B. To answer this correctly, you’d need to recall Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs pyramid\\nand the five steps within the pyramid. The question asks for the highest level, which\\naccording to the pyramid is self-actualization.\\n170. C. A milestone has a duration of zero; it is a significant point or event in the project, such\\nas the completion of a deliverable.\\n171. D. Attending an expo does not translate to spying on the competition and is an\\nexample of networking. On a smaller scale, examples of networking include informal\\nconversations, committee gatherings, luncheons, and so on. In this scenario, Bob is being\\nproactive through his actions.\\n172. C. Of the options provided, the project management office (PMO) would be the best\\nchoice. The PMO is responsible for providing project managers with training and\\nresources. They also have archived organizational process assets, which would help in this\\nscenario, along with training. Offering to manage the project with him is implying that\\nyou will take on part of his project and responsibility, which is an incorrect answer. Not\\noffering any type of assistance is a poor choice, since part of our responsibility as project\\nmanagers is to encourage and educate other project managers, although not at the expense\\nof your own projects.\\n173. A. The correct choice is observation and conversation. This is a technique that allows the\\nproject manager to observe the attitudes of team members toward the project and better\\ngauge what is going on. The project manager also gets direct feedback from team members.\\n174. B. Negotiation and staff assignments don’t pertain to where a team member is located.\\nThat leaves virtual team and colocation. Virtual team includes project team members who\\nare located at different locations, often never even meeting face to face. This can include\\nworking from home offices, from a remote location in general, and at different company\\nsites. Colocation is when project team members are brought to work together at the same\\nphysical location. Based on these descriptions, virtual team is the correct choice.\\n175. D. The risk manager is utilizing the expert judgment technique. This involves subject-\\nmatter experts who are internal or external to the project and who validate the data and\\ntechniques used to conduct the process.\\n176. B. Reports are considered formal written, since they are an official report of the project,\\nand they are delivered in written format.\\n177. A. The correct choice is fringe benefits, which are those benefits provided to all employees.\\n178. B. The theorist responsible for the 14 Steps to Quality Management is W. Edwards Deming.\\n179. A-4, B-1, C-3, D-2. There are four project life cycle categories: predictive, iterative,\\nincremental, and Agile. The life cycle selected to manage a project is driven by various\\nfactors, one of which is life-cycle goal.\\n180. A. The minimum viable product (MVP) is used to increase the speed of delivery and\\nobtain feedback of a product early. The product contains just enough features or\\ndeliverables to obtain feedback; this feedback can then be used for future incremental\\ndevelopment of the product.\\n181. B. Referent power is based on the respect or admiration that others hold for an individual.\\n182. C. It’s often thought that the project manager or functional manager is responsible for\\nresolving this type of conflict. But in actuality, these individuals should be brought in only\\nto provide assistance or to address the conflict in a formal manner. The best option is that\\nthe project team members resolve the conflict on their own, directly.\\n183. C. Conflict management is not a form of feedback; 360-degree feedback is a formal type\\nof feedback, as opposed to observation and conversation. 360-degree feedback is a type of\\nappraisal, whereas team performance assessment focuses on the team’s performance.\\n184. A. Money already spent refers to sunk costs. Opportunity cost refers to money lost when\\nselecting one project over another, equaling the value of the project that was passed up.\\nDirect costs are costs that are directly attributed to the work on the project. Fixed costs\\nare costs that remain the same throughout the project, such as rentals.\\n185. A. Negotiations and project staff assignments take place within the Acquire Project Team\\nprocess, the second process within the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area.\\n326 \\n186. C. Gold plating is when additional functionality is added that is outside of the project\\nscope. Sometimes this is done with good intentions, but it is not considered acceptable,\\nno matter what the intent is. If the addition was not a part of the project requirements,\\nquality is not considered to have been met.\\n187. B. Joseph Juran is connected to the concept that the results produced should be fit for use\\nby the customer.\\n188. A. Exploit is a strategy used when the organization is interested in making sure that\\nthe risk occurs, as well as increasing the impact of the positive risks. Exploit is the exact\\nopposite of avoid, which seeks to eliminate the possibility of the risk occurring. The\\nprimary difference between exploit and enhance is that exploit applies changes to ensure\\nthat the opportunity will occur, which may or may not include an increase in the\\nimpact, while enhance only increases the likelihood and/or impact of the opportunity\\noccurring.\\n189. D. Quality metrics determine what to measure and what the acceptable measurements are.\\n190. B. There are three types of organizational structures: functional, matrix, and project-\\noriented.\\n191. D. Empathy, influence, and creativity are forms of interpersonal skills, also referred to\\nas soft skills. Interpersonal skills itself is part of general management skills. It is thought\\nthat the project manager can decrease issues and increase cooperation by understanding\\nhow project team members are feeling, knowing what their concerns are, and being able to\\nfollow up on existing issues.\\n192. B. Defining what acceptable behavior looks like may have taken care of this issue from\\nthe start. Even though John felt that Nick’s issue was not an immediate priority, all issues\\nshould be allowed to be brought to the table or through the outlined procedures.\\n193. C. The correct answer is poor quality. Remember that quality also looks to remove waste\\nand non-value-added processes. It looks to improve processes and make sure that project\\nrequirements are being met.\\n194. C. The project charter is created to formalize a project. Following the start of the project,\\nidentification and analysis of stakeholders come next.\\n195. C. Benchmarking takes the current project and compares it to other projects, using the\\nprevious projects as the point of comparison.\\n196. B. As the sender of the information, the project team member is responsible for\\nconfirming that the project manager understood the information and that the information\\nis complete and clear. On the other end, the project manager also failed to meet the\\nresponsibilities of a receiver, which are to make sure that they understood the information\\ncorrectly and that it was received in its entirety.\\n197. D. The resource management plan is a component of the project management plan. It\\noutlines the training needs, safety needs, and compliance of the project. As an extra note,\\nit also contains details of how the project team will be acquired, managed, and released.\\n198. B. 360-degree feedback is a type of project performance appraisal, where feedback is\\nreceived from all levels of interaction with a team member. This provides information\\nabout a team member but not from a team member. Next, observation and conversation\\ncome together as a technique from the Manage Project Team process. It’s a way for the\\nproject manager to monitor the team’s progress, accomplishments, and interpersonal\\nissues and is therefore the correct answer. Issue log simply tracks issues so is not relevant\\nhere, and team-building activities seems like a good choice, except that the purpose is to\\ngrow relationships among the team so the focus is on establishing this cohesiveness and of\\nworking together, not of assessing work attitudes.\\n199. D. A face-to-face meeting is the preferred method for dealing with stakeholders. There\\nis nothing within the question to indicate that a one-on-one meeting with stakeholders is\\nrequired, which makes “an in-person meeting” the best and most efficient choice.\\n200. D. PERT stands for program evaluation and review technique and uses a weighted average\\nof the following three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. PERT analysis is\\nused as part of the three-point estimating tool and technique within the Estimate Activity\\nDurations and Estimate Costs processes.'"

    "answer_text='1. B. Expected value can be calculated using a triangular distribution (simple average) or\\nbeta distribution (weighted average). The three-point estimating formula that uses a beta\\ndistribution is as follows: (Optimistic + Pessimistic + (4 × Most Likely)) ÷ 6, Plug in the\\nvalues provided to calculate the following: ($25 + $50 + ($35 × 4)) ÷ 6 = $35,8 or 36 when\\nrounded to the nearest whole number.\\n2. D. Iterative life cycles focus on correctness of solution. For this reason, stakeholder\\nfeedback is obtained early and often, such as through prototypes, so that changes can be\\nincorporated into the solution based on feedback and insights received.\\n3. A. The Expectancy Theory states that employees who believe that more effort will lead\\nto better performance, which will then lead to rewards that they personally value, will\\ncontinue to be productive. This is a conscious choice; otherwise, if they don’t value the\\nrewards, their incentive to be productive is lost.\\n308 \\n4. B. Outputs of the Define Activities process include the activity list, activity attributers,\\nmilestone list, change requests, and project management plan updates. The question has\\nalready indicated that the activity list has already been created, and the milestone list is\\nthe only viable option.\\n5. C. Team-building activities increase team collaboration and social relationships, as\\nwell as foster a cooperative working environment. A team benefits from continuous\\nteam-building activities throughout the life of the project; it is particularly important\\nduring the early stages of a project, when relationships among team members are not yet\\ndeveloped.\\n6. C. The Determine Budget process establishes the cost baseline for the project and is an\\noutput of this process.\\n7. B. All of the options listed are types of communication. When dealing with complex\\nissues, it is best to use a written format that is formal. Formal written is also the best\\nchoice when working with other cultures, communicating over long distances, updating a\\nplan, or dealing with legal matters.\\n8. B. While the risk management plan covers the details of risk-related reports and formats,\\nit does not cover all of the communication requirements of project stakeholders. This is\\naddressed within the communications management plan.\\n9. A. While several benefits to virtual teams are included within the various options, this\\nparticular project requires a specialized skill set. Since virtual teams widen the resource\\npool available, with team members potentially located across the globe, it allows for this\\nunique resource need to be met. Without the use of virtual teams, the project may not\\nhave been possible, or it may have been very costly due to relocating team members or\\nfrequent travel.\\n10. A, B, D. Daily stand-ups encourage the team to remain self-organized and hold each other\\naccountable for completing work that they have committed to. Whereas iteration-based\\nAgile focuses on accountability, flow-based Agile focuses on the team’s throughput.\\n11. C. Philip Crosby believed that quality is achieved when zero defects are present, and if\\na defect is present and considered acceptable, then the requirements should be altered to\\nreflect this fact.\\n12. A, C. Knowledge can be split into explicit and tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge can\\nbe captured and expressed using words, pictures, and numbers; tacit knowledge is more\\ndifficult to capture or express, such as beliefs, experiences, and “know-how.”\\n13. D. Level of accuracy describes your rounding precision, and units of measure describes\\nhow you will measure resources, for example, days, weeks, months.\\n14. D. You are currently performing activities associated with the Control Schedule process,\\nwhich is part of the Monitoring and Controlling process group.\\n15. B, C, D. There are various Agile suitability filters and/or models available that help\\ndetermine whether an organization would benefit from adopting Agile approaches. A\\nbroad model presented within the Agile Practice Guide assesses organizations against\\nthree categories: culture (i.e., does the environment support the approach?), team (i.e., is\\nthe team of a suitable size?), and project (i.e., are there high rates of change?).\\n16. C. Internal rate of return is when the present value of the cash inflows equals the original\\ninvestment; payback period refers to the number of periods (in this case months) that\\nmust pass before the initial investment is recouped. While both Project X and Project\\nRevolution have an IRR of 3 percent, project revolution has a shorter payback period.\\n17. C. Transformational is a form of leadership style where the leader encourages the ideas of\\nothers, innovation, and creativity.\\n18. B. The WBS serves as the basis for estimating costs. It is an input to the Estimate Costs\\nprocess through the scope baseline, which is part of the project management plan. It\\ncontains all the project deliverables and the control accounts associated with work\\npackage elements.\\n19. A, D. While Agile teams vary, typical characteristics include the following: they range\\nin size from three to nine team members, they are colocated, and they are 100 percent\\ndedicated to the team.\\n20. B. The Five-Factor Model, also known as the Big Five personality traits, is a personality\\nsurvey that identifies five broad dimensions used to describe an individual’s personality.\\nThe five factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness,\\nand neuroticism. The conscientiousness domain measures where individuals fall on the\\nspectrum of efficient versus careless.\\n21. A. Prototypes allow for early feedback on the requirements for further refinement and\\nclarification. They are a technique used as part of the Collect Requirements process.\\n22. D. You are carrying out the Create WBS process. The purpose of the process is to\\nsubdivide the project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable\\ncomponents.\\n23. B. Kanban is an agile approach that is often used in manufacturing projects but also\\nmakes a presence in the information technology field. Using Kanban, the work is balanced\\nagainst available resources or available capacity for work. It’s a pull-based concept where\\nwork progresses to the next step only when resources are available.\\n24. C. The formula for calculating expected monetary value is probability times impact. Plug\\nin the values to get the following: 10% × $4,000 = $400\\n25. A-1, B-5, C-3, D-2, E-4, There are several Agile-based approaches that follow iterative or\\nflow-based Agile methods. In addition to the various flavors of Agile, hybrid approaches\\nalso exist, such as Scrumban (a combination of Kanban and Scrum).\\n310 \\n26. B. The Determine Budget process yields the cost baseline, project funding requirements,\\nand updates to project documents. The project funding requirements represent the total\\nfunding requirements and periodic funding requirements of the project.\\n27. A, B, D. The organizational breakdown structure, bill of materials, risk breakdown\\nstructure, and resource breakdown structure all present project information in a\\nhierarchical fashion. The resource assignment matrix does not.\\n28. B. The quality management plan may describe measurements that fall within a specified\\nrange. These are called tolerable results.\\n29. B. The project manager has told the scheduler that the schedule must be compressed\\nby one week. That means that we will use one of two schedule compression techniques:\\ncrashing or fast-tracking, both of which are options. When possible, select the lowest-cost\\noption first, which would be fast-tracking.\\n30. B. If the team maintains a velocity of 60 story points per iteration, it would take seven\\niterations to complete the remaining 420 story points.\\n31. A, B, C. Servant leaders engage the team and take on a selfless view by serving others. They\\ndo this by approaching their work in the following order: purpose, people, and process.\\n32. C. Cost baselines and schedule baselines are used to measure performance in the\\nExecuting and Monitoring and Controlling processes.\\n33. A, B, C. The probability and impact matrix is not an input to the Perform Quantitative\\nRisk Analysis process. It is used to prioritize risks, it’s defined in the risk management\\nplan, and it’s used as a tool and technique in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis\\nprocess.\\n34. C. The correct answer is that inspection keeps errors from reaching the customer, while\\nprevention prevents errors from occurring.\\n35. D. A burndown chart is used to track the remaining work to be completed against the\\nbacklog. It shows work completed to date by iteration and the forecasted rate at which\\nthe team will complete the remaining work over the remaining iterations, based on\\nvelocity.\\n36. B. Requirements are documented through user stories that make up the backlog. The user\\nstories are then prioritized and refined.\\n37. C. The project budget includes the cost baseline. Option C has it backward.\\n38. C. To calculate the critical path, you must first draw out the network diagram and\\nthen add the duration of each activity that falls within the individual network paths.\\nFigure 6.1 shows the network diagram and the three network paths that exist within it.\\nThe following is the duration of each of those paths: A-B-D-F = 17, A-C-D-F = 19, A-C-\\nE-F = 21.\\nFigurE 6.1 Network diagram: critical path\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\nFloat: Float:\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\nFloat: 2 4 Float:\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 6\\nFloat: Float:\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n4 6\\n39. C. To calculate the early finish of activity D, you would first need to perform a forward\\npass. To calculate forward pass, draw the network diagram and then follow these steps:\\n1) Begin with the first activity.\\n2) The calculation of the first activity begins with an early start date of 1) Add the\\nduration of the activity and then subtract 1 to determine the early finish. This is based\\non the concept of calendar days.\\n3) The early start date of the next activity is the early finish date of the previous activity\\nplus 1) Continue calculating the early start and early finish dates forward through all\\nthe network paths while following the existing dependencies.\\n4) When an activity has two connecting predecessors, the early start date would be the\\nearly finish of the predecessor that finishes last, plus 1)\\nFigure 6,2 shows the network diagram with early start and early finish dates calculated.\\nFigurE 6,2 Network diagram: forward pass\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n6 Float: 7 10 Float: 13\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n1 Float: 5 2 4 16 Float: 21\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 6\\n6 Float: 9 10 Float: 15\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n4 6\\n40. A. To calculate the late start of activity C, you would first need to perform a forward\\npass and a backward pass. To calculate backward pass, draw the network diagram and\\nperform a forward pass and then follow these steps:\\n1. Begin with the last activity. The late finish will be the same as the early finish date.\\n2. Subtract the duration of the activity from the end date and add 1 to calculate late\\nstart. Take this number and subtract 1 to calculate the late finish of its predecessors.\\n312 \\n3. Continue calculating the latest start and latest finish dates, moving backward through\\nall the network paths.\\n4. When an activity has two connecting predecessors, the late finish date would be the\\nlate start minus 1 of the activity that follows.\\nFigure 6.3 shows the network diagram with early start and early finish dates calculated.\\nFigurE 6.3 Network diagram: backward pass\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n6 Float: 7 10 Float: 13\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n1 Float: 5 8 2 9 12 4 15 16 Float: 21\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n1 5 5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 16 6 21\\n6 Float: 9 10 Float: 15\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n6 4 9 10 6 15\\n41. A. Total float refers to the amount of time you can delay the earliest start of an activity\\nwithout delaying the ending of the project. To calculate total float, you would first need to\\ndraw the network diagram and then perform a forward pass and a backward pass. Next,\\nsubtract either the early start from the late start or the early finish from the late finish\\n(both should give you the same answer). Figure 6.4 shows the network diagram with total\\nfloat calculated.\\nFigurE 6.4 Network diagram: float\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n6 Float: 2 7 10 Float: 2 13\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nB D\\nEarly Start: Total Early Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish:\\n1 Float: 0 5 8 2 9 12 4 15 16 Float: 0 21\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nA F\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n1 5 5 Early Start: Total Early Finish: Early Start: Total Early Finish: 16 6 21\\n6 Float: 0 9 10 Float: 0 15\\nActivity Name: Activity Name:\\nC E\\nLate Start: Duration: Late Finish: Late Start: Duration: Late Finish:\\n6 4 9 10 6 15\\n42. A, B, D. Agile PMOs guide the organization in achieving business value. There are\\nmultiple types of PMOs; an Agile PMO is value-driven, invitation-oriented, and\\nmultidisciplinary.\\n43. A. Resource leveling involves leveling out resource usage to resolve over-allocation of\\nresources and/or to level out the peaks and valleys of resource usage over time.\\n44. D. According to the Agile Practice Guide, the role of a servant leader is to facilitate the\\nteam’s discovery and definition of Agile.\\n45. B. The analogous estimating technique is a form of expert judgment, which uses the\\nactual duration of a similar activity completed on a previous project to determine the\\nduration of the current activity. This means that Alyssa would rely on feedback from the\\nsubject-matter expert who noted that in a past similar project it took 13 hours to complete\\na similar activity.\\n46. A, C, D. The Plan Procurement Management process can influence the project schedule\\n(and vice versa). The Estimate Activity Resources process, make-or-buy decisions, and the\\norganization’s business cycle may have an impact on the Plan Procurement Management\\nprocess.\\n47. C. Based on the activities Marysil has already carried out, the next logical step would\\nbe to begin implementing the risk responses based on plans documented in the risk\\nregister. While some risk responses are implemented when risk triggers occur, others are\\nimplemented immediately to avoid or exploit a risk.\\n48. C. Based on the performance indexes provided, the project is 10 percent ahead of\\nschedule but over budget. Leveling out resource usage is a strategy used to spread out\\ncosts over time. This helps in reducing sudden spikes in spending, although it may lead to\\nlengthening the schedule.\\n49. A, C, D. There are four primary events used by Scrum teams: sprint planning, daily\\nscrum (versus weekly), sprint review, and sprint retrospective.\\n50. D. Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the\\nquantity of work by the rate or uses an algorithm in conjunction with historical data to\\ndetermine cost, budget, or duration estimates. Based on this definition, take 1,320 and\\ndivide by 110 to get 12.\\n51. C. The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is the projected cost performance the\\nremaining work of the project must achieve in order to meet the BAC or EAC.\\n52. C. There are five types of power that a project manager can utilize. These include formal,\\nreward, penalty, expert, and referent. The question asks for the one that is based on the\\nrespect or admiration that others hold for an individual, which is referent power.\\n53. B, C, D. Only the Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM) uses dummy activities, which are\\nnot real activities but instead are meant to show that a relationship between two activities\\nexists. All other statements are accurate.\\n54. A, D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, there are four common project life cycles:\\npredictive, iterative, incremental, and Agile. Hybrid refers to a combination of two or\\nmore life cycles.\\n55. D. The project charter is generated at the start of a project. Before we can move forward\\nin planning or building out the backlog of the project, there is one key activity that a\\nproject manager should perform at the start of a project—building out the stakeholder\\nregister. This is created as a result of performing stakeholder analysis.\\n314 \\n56. C. A CPI of greater than 1 is performing under budget; an SPI of less than 1 is performing\\nbehind schedule. Remember that generally an index > 1 is good, an index = 1 is perfect,\\nand an index of < 1 is bad.\\n57. B. Independent peer review is the correct answer. This type of review ensures that the\\nconcepts, the designs, and the tests that are utilized at the beginning of the project were\\ngood choices.\\n58. A. Agile teams often create a team charter as a way of creating a social contract for the\\nteam. The team charter identifies team norms and an understanding of how the team is\\nto work together. This social contract captures team values, working agreements, ground\\nrules, and group norms.\\n59. F. Servant leaders enable teams to be more Agile and play the important role of facilitating\\nthe team’s success. According to the Agile Practice Guide, characteristics of a servant\\nleader include promoting self-awareness, listening, serving the team, helping others grow,\\ncoaching versus controlling, promoting safety/respect/trust, and promoting the energy and\\nintelligence of others.\\n60. C. The matrix diagrams tool includes two-dimensional and three-dimensional diagrams.\\nIt is a part of the data representation tools and techniques of the Manage Quality process.\\n61. C. Halo effect is when a person’s strong traits are perceived as an indication of another\\ntrait. In this example, it is thought that because Jon is good at his job, he must therefore be a\\ngood project manager. But the job of a research technician has different required skills than\\nthe job of a project manager. The most common example given is that an attractive person,\\nsuch as a celebrity, must be intelligent, which is why they are often used in advertising.\\n62. D. At this point, pre-assignments is a technique already used, and the issue is that a\\nkey resource was not pre-assigned and is now unavailable. The best option would be to\\nnegotiate with the project managers of the other two projects, along with the resource’s\\nfunctional manager, to open up availability for participation in the project in question.\\nAcquisition may be a potential option, but not until negotiation has been attempted.\\n63. B. Specification limits and assignable cause are related to control charts and are therefore\\nnot the correct answers; trend analysis relates to run chart, also not the answer. That\\nleaves the 80/20 rule, also known as Pareto’s Law or the Pareto Principle, which states\\nthat 80 percent of problems result from 20 percent of causes. This is exactly what the\\nproject manager in this scenario is looking for.\\n64. A. Incremental life cycles focus on speed through frequent smaller deliveries. This\\nsupports a project with dynamic requirements that allow the project team to hand over\\ncompleted deliverables to the customer that can be used immediately. Other options refer\\nto predictive, iterative, and Agile life cycles.\\n65. B. Only “formal written” and “informal written” are communication types. Email can be\\nconsidered to be a formal or informal way of communicating, depending on the contents.\\nIn the context of the scenario presented, email is considered to be informal.\\n66. A, B, D. Risks on a watch list are low-priority risks that are determined to contain a\\nminimal amount of threat but that should be monitored regularly for a change of status as\\nthe project moves forward. All other statements are true.\\n67. B, E. While all options may have contributed to the project issues, a poorly written scope\\ncan quickly result in project failure, no matter how good the change control procedures or\\nsystems are. A lack of formal project management may have contributed as well but being\\ncertified does not guarantee that this type of scenario will not occur. The scope baseline\\nis often used for change control purposes and in making project decisions, which is why a\\npoorly written scope will result in a large number of project changes for projects managed\\nusing a predictive life-cycle approach. Given that the project contained high ambiguity,\\nissues may have been reduced by using an adaptive or hybrid life-cycle approach.\\n68. A. Negotiation is a common technique used by project managers to acquire resources\\nfor a project. Ideally, the project manager would have first approached the director of\\nengineering for approval, but at this stage, the best option was to attempt to negotiate\\nwith the resource’s manager. The project sponsor should not get involved in cases like this\\nunless it is detrimental to the project.\\n69. B. The best choice is to note the issue within the issue log. The reason for this is that an\\nowner can then be assigned to the issue, and a target resolution date set. This allows for\\nmore structured and documented resolution. The issue log is also something that will be\\narchived at a later date within the project files.\\n70. E. While retrospectives are often held at the conclusion of an iteration or increment,\\nteams can facilitate retrospectives at various key points in a project to gain benefits. This\\nincludes situations where the team does not feel that the work is flowing well. While teams\\nare not necessarily limited as to when retrospectives are held, they are typically used after\\nthe project work begins.\\n71. B. Observation and conversation is a technique from the Manage Team process and\\ndescribes a way for the project manager to monitor the team’s progress, accomplishments,\\nand interpersonal issues, and it is therefore the correct answer. 360-degree feedback is\\na type of project performance appraisal, where feedback is received from all levels of\\ninteraction with a team member. This provides information about a team member, but\\nnot from the team member themselves. Issue log tracks issues so is not relevant here,\\nand team-building activities seems like a good choice, except that the purpose is to grow\\nrelationships among the team, with a focus on establishing cohesiveness, not assessing\\nwork attitudes.\\n72. A. To solve a decision tree, calculate the expected monetary value of each scenario.\\nExpected monetary value can be calculated by multiplying the impact by the probability.\\nScenario A has a potential implication of –$1,250, and scenario B has a potential\\nimplication of –$2,275. Therefore, scenario A is the best choice.\\n73. D. Knowledge can be split into two types: explicit or tacit. Explicit knowledge can be\\ncaptured and expressed using words, pictures, and numbers; tacit knowledge is more\\ndifficult to capture or express, such as beliefs, experiences, and “know-how.”\\n316 \\n74. D. The project manager is using the Stacey Complexity Model to plot the degree of\\ncertainty about the complexity elements, such as requirements, technical challenges, or\\nteam skills. The degrees are measured as low uncertainty or agreement to high uncertainty\\nor lack of agreement. Projects that fall within the complicated and complex quadrants are\\nbest suited for Adaptive approaches, while projects that fall within the simple quadrant\\nare best suited for predictive/linear approaches.\\n75. B. The project charter is typically signed off by the project’s sponsor, who is responsible\\nfor approving the project. In this case, Nicolas is identified as the sponsor and is therefore\\nthe correct answer.\\n76. B. The concept of continuous improvement centers around the idea that small or\\nincremental improvements within a product or process has the ability to reduce cost and\\nkeep consistency of performance. The word kaizen in Japan translates to “change for the\\nbetter.”\\n77. C. The question refers to a key input of the Direct and Manage Project Work process,\\nwhich is a process that provides overall management of the project work and deliverables.\\nWhile several inputs are important, without the approved change requests, you cannot\\ncomplete the activities referenced in the question.\\n78. B. A retrospective is similar to a lessons learned session in that the team learns from\\nprevious work. Retrospectives are a way for Agile teams to learn about and improve the\\nprocess. Oftentimes, teams will commit to improving one item during the next iteration.\\n79. D. Interpersonal skills are used by the project manager to build trust, resolve conflict,\\nactively listen to stakeholders, and overcome resistance to change. It is a technique used by\\nthe Manage Stakeholder Engagement, Develop Project Team, and Manage Project Team\\nprocesses.\\n80. D. A team charter is also referred to as a social contract. This document captures how\\nteam members are to interact with one another, including their ground rules, group\\nnorms, working agreements, and team values.\\n81. A. As a project manager, it is your responsibility to contribute to the project management\\nknowledge base, which includes educating others on project management practices.\\nIndependent estimates is a tool and technique of the Plan Procurement Management.\\n82. D. Data analysis is a tool and technique of the Estimate Costs process. There are several\\ntechniques that are part of data analysis, such as alternatives analysis. Other techniques\\ninclude reserve analysis and cost of quality.\\n83. A. To calculate CPI, use the following formula: CPI = EV ÷ AC. Plug in the values to\\ncalculate the following: 1,700 ÷ 1,950 = 0.87. A CPI of less than 1 means that the project\\nis performing over budget.\\n84. C. The transfer strategy involves the transfer of a risk to a third party. In this case, the\\nthird party manages and takes responsibility for the risk. Insurance is one example of risk\\ntransference.\\n85. C. Sensitivity analysis determines which risks have the most potential impact on the\\nproject and utilizes tornado diagrams. This type of diagram compares the importance of\\nvariables that have a high degree of uncertainty to the more stable variables.\\n86. A-5, B-2, C-1, D-3, E-4. There are five types of conflict resolution technique: withdraw/\\navoid, smooth/accommodate, compromise/reconcile, force/direct, collaborate/\\nproblem-solve.\\n87. C. This statement describes virtual teams. Virtual teams consist of individuals who\\nare dispersed across various locations and interact primarily through technology, such\\nas video conference, online, chat, telephone, etc. There is minimal to no face time.\\nColocation is the exact opposite, where team members are physically located in the same\\nplace.\\n88. B. The power/interest grid groups stakeholders based on their level of authority, a\\nreference to power, and, by level of concern, a reference to interest.\\n89. A. Kaylee has just performed the Implement Risk Responses process and is likely to carry\\nout activities associated with the Monitor Risks process next. Risk audits are a tool and\\ntechnique used to evaluate the effectiveness of risk responses that have been implemented,\\nand typically occur either through risk review meetings or through dedicated risk audit\\nmeetings.\\n90. A. The question is asking for the most common source of conflict. The correct answer is\\nscarce resources. The other common sources of conflict include scheduling priorities and\\npersonal work styles.\\n91. D. The project is not officially considered to be complete until the customer or buyer\\nsigns off. This is a mistake many companies make, which leaves the door open for further\\nrequests or conflict as to whether the project was really completed. Formal closure\\naddresses it directly by obtaining agreement from the customer that the deliverables and\\nscope have indeed been met.\\n92. E. The Agile Manifesto lists four values: individuals and interactions over processes and\\ntools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over\\ncontract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.\\n93. B, C, D. The resource management plan describes when and how resource requirements\\nwill be met. It addresses things such as staff acquisition, timetable of when the team will\\nbe acquired, release criteria, training needs, recognition and rewards, compliance, and\\nsafety. It doesn’t, however, define the roles and responsibilities, which is a separate output\\nof the human resource management planning process.\\n94. B. The communications management plan offers the who, what, where, why, and when of\\ncommunications and reporting. This plan should contain the detailed information of when\\nthe report in question is scheduled for distribution.\\n95. A. Noise is defined as anything that may interfere with getting or receiving the message\\n(such as static). Only noise and medium were official terms provided within the four\\noptions, according to the basic model of communication.\\n318 \\n96. B. Under organizational process assets, the project management team utilizes the\\npolicies, procedures, guidelines, and management systems that pertain to procurement.\\nIt’s important to understand how the company currently conducts procurement activities,\\nwhich will aid the project team in compiling a good procurement management plan.\\n97. C. All options provided are forms of probability distribution. The most commonly used\\nprobability distributions are beta distributions and triangular distributions. Since beta is\\nthe only one of the two included as an option, it is the best choice.\\n98. C. Cost-reimbursable, also known as cost plus, is a contract type where the buyer agrees\\nto pay the seller for all actual costs incurred in completing the work, plus an additional\\namount. Some cost plus contracts pay an additional fixed fee, while others pay an\\nadditional award fee or incentive fee. The buyer is the one with the highest risk, since they\\nmay have little control over the seller’s spending.\\n99. D. Templates are stored within the organizational process assets. When using templates\\nfrom previous similar projects, the project manager can create a consistency of results,\\nsuch as by using portions of activity lists or network diagrams, thereby making more\\nefficient use of their time. It also allows for improved results.\\n100. C. The project manager is using the Stacey Complexity Model to plot the degree of\\ncertainty about the complexity elements, such as requirements, technical challenges, or\\nteam skills. This model displays levels of uncertainty from low to high on both the x- and\\ny-axes, or it may show levels of uncertainty on the x-axis and agreement levels on the\\ny-axis. This two-dimensional model shows the progression of the certainty and agreement\\nof complexity elements, which are plotted into categories such as simple or chaotic.\\n101. D. A fishbowl window is a method of creating a shared virtual workspace to\\naccommodate team members who are dispersed across multiple locations. Individuals\\ncan join a live video stream at the start of their workday and close it out at the end of the\\nworkday. This method is intended to increase collaboration.\\n102. C. The sender, who initiated the communication, is the project team member; the receiver\\nof the information is the project manager.\\n103. D. Notice that Sally took in the facts and made a choice on the spot, without listening\\nto the two-team members or attempting to discuss the choices. This type of conflict\\nresolution technique is known as forcing, where one person makes a decision without\\ntaking into account others’ feedback. Forcing is also known as directing.\\n104. D. A RACI is a type of responsibility assignment matrix (RAM), and it stands for\\nresponsible, accountable, consult, and inform.\\n105. B. The answer is cost of conformance to requirements. While quality works toward\\npreventing rework and providing better customer satisfaction, these are results of\\nconforming to the project requirements.\\n106. B. Pre-assignments occur when individuals have been promised as part of a contract to\\na customer, or they have been assigned as early as the project charter. In either case, the\\nresource has officially been committed to the project.\\n107. D. The question provides examples of project management information systems, which\\nis a tool and technique of the Manage Communications process. Information systems are\\ntools used to facilitate communication.\\n108. F. Projects may follow different project life cycles, depending on the organization and\\nunique needs of the project. According to the PMBOK® Guide, typical projects can be\\nmapped to a generic project life-cycle structure: starting the project, organizing and\\npreparing, carrying out the work, and closing the project.\\n109. A. When managing a project, you should always be aware of the local laws affecting the\\nproject, as well as the political climate. By being aware of the political climate, the project\\nteam would have planned and taken preventive actions. The question is not necessarily\\nasking you how to avoid the rally but, instead, how to prevent it from affecting the\\nproject.\\n110. D. Gold plating is a term often tied to quality. It involves giving customers extras that\\nare not included in the project scope, meaning that it is a form of scope creep. This can\\ninclude things like extra features, increasing performance, and adjusting components.\\n111. C. There are four primary items that the process improvement plan contains: process\\nboundaries, process configuration, process metrics, and targets for improved performance.\\nTherefore, failure rate is the correct answer.\\n112. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, the 100 percent rule refers to the work breakdown\\nstructure including all of the work of the project. The WBS therefore represents all of the\\nproduct and project work, which can be best described as the scope of the project.\\n113. D. Mitigation reduces the probability and/or the impact of a risk. Other options describe\\nthe transfer, avoid, and enhance strategies.\\n114. D. According to the PMBOK® Guide, business value is defined as the net quantifiable\\nbenefit derived from a business endeavor. Benefits may be both tangible and intangible.\\n115. A. A fixed-price contract, also known as lump sum, is where the seller provides an\\nestimate for the work, negotiates with the buyer, and commits to doing the work at that\\nprice. The seller has the greatest risk, because if the estimate was not good, they may end\\nup with little to no profit.\\n116. C. The question is asking for the project team to get to all the possible causes. There are a\\nfew potential answers, but based on the question and options provided, a cause-and-effect\\ndiagram is the best choice. This is the diagram that resembles a fishbone and shows how\\nvarious factors can be connected to potential problems.\\n117. A. All of the options included are risk attitudes. The names of the risk attitudes are fairly\\ndescriptive, making them easy to understand at face value.\\n118. B. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consult, and inform. The chart identifies\\nAlfred as being responsible for the Research activity, making him the correct answer.\\nResponsible indicates who will be performing the work.\\n320 \\n119. C. A team performance assessment has a goal of increasing the team’s performance, while\\nproject performance appraisals are feedback given directly to project team members. Team\\nperformance assessments are an output of the Develop Project Team process.\\n120. F. A team charter serves as a type of social contract for the team. According to the Agile\\nPractice Guide, the team charter captures team values, working agreements, ground rules,\\nand group norms.\\n121. C. An influence/impact grid can be split into four quadrants, where stakeholders will be\\nplotted against according to their level of influence and impact. Stakeholders with low\\ninfluence/low impact are likely to be monitored; stakeholders with high influence/low\\nimpact will likely be kept satisfied; stakeholders with low influence/high impact are likely\\nto be kept informed; and stakeholders with high influence/high impact are likely to be\\nmanaged closely. Tony falls in the latter of the options stated.\\n122. C. This is a great example of where multiple options appear correct. For example, you\\ncan argue that option A is correct, since the description fits a project. However, the\\nbest answer is that it is a program. A program is defined as a group of related projects\\ncoordinated together. A portfolio also contains a group of projects that have been grouped\\nin such a way as to meet a specific and strategic business objective, but not necessarily\\nbecause the projects are related. Work package is incorrect, since it refers to a deliverable\\nwithin a work breakdown structure.\\n123. F. Cost of quality refers to any related costs resulting from carrying out quality activities.\\nThis is considered an investment of time, money, and resources, which technically all boils\\ndown to an investment of money. The correct choice is rework.\\n124. A, B, D. A run chart is a type of quality tool and therefore not a format you would use to\\ndisplay an organizational chart.\\n125. B. The project manager is responsible for providing project team members with the\\nappropriate level of training needed to perform the work.\\n126. B. Perquisites is another type of benefits offered; they are often called “perks,” making it\\nthe correct answer.\\n127. B. In a start-to-start relationship, the successor activity (activity B) must wait for its\\npredecessor (activity A) to start before it can start. Since both activities are beginning as\\nsoon as possible, we can assume that activity B will begin immediately after activity A\\nstarts. However, there is a lag of two days, meaning that activity B must wait two days to\\nstart after activity A has started. That means that from the moment that A starts, activity\\nB will not be completed until nine days have passed (just add the duration of the activity,\\nplus the two day lag). Since the activities overlap in this scenario, then the duration that\\nhas passed for both activities to finish will have been 10 days total.\\n128. D. The project manager should allow team members to resolve their own conflict.\\nHowever, when the issue escalates and requires the involvement of the project manager,\\nthe best method is to collaborate (or problem-solve) to resolve the issue. This is a\\nrecommended conflict resolution technique because it leads to a win-win situation.\\n129. A-5, B-1, C-3, D-2, E-4. A project manager may leverage various leadership styles to\\naccommodate various situations and organizational norms. There are five leadership\\nstyles referenced within the PMBOK® Guide: Laissez-faire, transactional, servant leader,\\ntransformational, charismatic, interactional. Agile teams favor servant leadership due to\\nits focus on team.\\n130. C. Based on the question, the VP is clearly a stakeholder of the project, which means\\nthat they were not previously identified. If all stakeholders have not been identified, this\\nmeans that all expectations, needs, and requirements have not been fully documented and\\nresolved, which can create major issues within the project.\\n131. B. The definition of a project, as defined by the PMBOK® Guide, is “a temporary\\nendeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.” What the question is\\ntesting is whether you recognize the difference between a project and operational work.\\nThe definition of operational work is work that is ongoing, repetitive, and meant to\\nsustain a business.\\n132. A. Minimum viable products (MVP) contain just enough features or deliverables to\\nobtain feedback; this feedback can then be used for future incremental development of the\\nproduct.\\n133. A. Rolling wave planning is where work in the near term is planned out in detail, while\\nwork in the future is planned out at higher levels of the WBS. While this is a form of\\nprogressive elaboration, rolling wave planning is a more specific choice. Progressive\\nelaboration and rolling wave planning are different from scope creep in that they are\\nplanned and controlled.\\n134. B. The correct response is to allow the audit to take place. Audits are not always planned,\\nand the purpose is to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of quality. Discovering\\nexisting inefficiencies will highly benefit the team. Audits are a win-win; even if sometimes\\nit feels like an inconvenience, the big picture must remain at the forefront.\\n135. D. Target benefits refer to the tangible and intangible business value to be gained by the\\nimplementation of the product, service, or result. They are typically documented within a\\nbenefits management plan that details how and when benefits will be achieved.\\n136. D. A benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of a project will be\\ndelivered. It captures the timeframe for realizing benefits, both during the project’s life\\nspan and during post-project closure.\\n137. D. Osmotic communication is a form of polite eavesdropping and is used within the\\nCrystal method. It occurs when there are conversations going on in the background but\\nare within earshot of the team. Team members overhear conversations and may realize the\\ntopic has importance to the project.\\n138. D. As the sender of the message, the project manager is responsible for confirming that\\nthe message was understood correctly and that the information was clear and complete. In\\nthis scenario, the project manager assumed that the message was understood.\\n322 \\n139. E. There are specific factors considered in the development of roles and responsibilities.\\nThey are organizational, technical, interpersonal, logistical, and political.\\n140. C. Procurement audits are structured reviews that audit the procurement management\\nprocesses. The idea is to pinpoint what the efficiencies and inefficiencies were within the\\nprocurement management processes, which will be documented as part of the lessons\\nlearned. This information is important for future procurements, whether for the current\\nproject or future projects.\\n141. C. The correct answer is forcing, which is a type of conflict resolution technique, not\\na leadership style. There are six primary leadership styles: laissez-faire, transactional,\\nservant leader, transformational, charismatic, and interactional.\\n142. A. The accuracy level of One Sigma is 68.27 percent.\\n143. A. The EAC formula for this question is BAC ÷ CPI. First, calculate CPI, which is EV ÷\\nAC: 145 ÷ 138 = 1.05. Plugging in the numbers from the question, you get 200 ÷ 1.05 =\\n190.\\n144. A. Brainstorming is when individuals are brought together to generate and collect ideas\\non a variety of topics, such as requirements.\\n145. D. Kanban is based on lean-thinking principles and helps the team stay organized; it keeps\\nteam members collaborating and everyone informed. A flow-based agile approach such as\\nKanban pulls work from the backlog according to the team’s capacity to perform the work.\\n146. C. The project manager applies general management skills to coordinate and harmonize\\nthe group of stakeholders toward accomplishing the project objectives. General\\nmanagement skills is a technique of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process.\\n147. D. The Agile Manifesto identifies 12 principles that describe the Agile approach. It came\\nabout through a group of software developers who came together in 2001 to formalize the\\nAgile approach.\\n148. D. The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate when the present value of the cash\\ninflows equals the original investment. If basing project selection on the IRR, choose the\\nproject with a higher IRR value.\\n149. C. Colocation refers to team members working out of the same location physically.\\nCreating a war room is a method of colocation.\\n150. A. Virtual teams are team members located outside of the physical office where the\\nproject is primarily taking place.\\n151. D. It’s clear that the project manager did not check the resource calendars when creating\\nthe schedule. Resource calendars contain working and nonworking days of resources. This\\nincludes holidays, vacations, and when resources are idle.\\n152. D. Team-building activities build trust among the project team, allowing them to work in\\na more efficient and cohesive manner.\\n153. D. This refers to a milestone list that contains all the project’s milestones. It also notes\\nwhether a milestone is optional or mandatory. A milestone is a significant point or event in\\nthe project, and as the project progresses and the work is underway, the milestone list can\\nbe used as a benchmark to measure progress.\\n154. B. The correct answer is continuous improvement. The word kaizen means to change for\\nthe better in Japanese.\\n155. A. It is impossible, and sometimes inefficient, to plan out a project to perfection. There\\nare too many moving parts and factors, regardless of the similarity that projects may\\nhave to others managed in the past. A good project manager understands that change\\nis inevitable, which is why project maintenance, varying project life cycles, and overall\\nproject management is so important.\\n156. D. In this question, you’re taken to the Plan Human Resource Management process. What\\nSue is doing is adding value to the project. Networking is a form of informal interaction\\nwith others as a way of understanding political and interpersonal factors that impact\\nthe project and developing industry relationships and partnerships (if done within the\\ncompany, it would be building of relationships and partnerships internally).\\n157. B. The stakeholder management plan, which is created out of the Plan Stakeholder\\nManagement process, identifies the strategies needed to effectively engage stakeholders.\\nThe plan is based on the stakeholder analysis completed as part of creating the stakeholder\\nregister. While the project management plan is also technically correct, it is not the best\\nanswer as a more specific option was available.\\n158. A-4, B-3, C-1, D-2. The Crystal method is actually a family of methodologies that\\nare designed to scale to the project needs. It examines three factors to determine which\\nCrystal methodology to use: criticality of the project, priority of the project, and number\\nof people involved.\\n159. D. The top three sources of conflict include scarce resources, scheduling priorities, and\\npersonal work styles.\\n160. B. Cost-reimbursable contracts are a higher risk to the buyer. This is because the buyer\\nreimburses the seller for the seller’s actual cost, plus an additional amount, and depending\\non the type of cost-reimbursable contract will determine whether this additional fee is\\ncapped. For this reason, this contract is typically used when the buyer can describe the\\nwork but not how to go about the work.\\n161. D. Organizational process assets contain historical information from past archived\\nprojects, lessons learned, templates, policies, procedures, and other valuable information.\\nIn this case, the project manager is using a previous schedule management plan as a\\ntemplate and tailoring it for use by the current project. This is recommended practice and\\nprevents having to re-invent the wheel for every project. Instead, the effort is placed on\\nincreasing the efficiency and refining existing practices and templates.\\n162. A. The lowest level of the WBS is the work package level. The next step from there would\\nbe to decompose the work packages into the activity lists. The activity list, however, is not\\nconsidered to be part of the WBS itself. Planning packages and control accounts are placed\\nwithin the WBS but are not the lowest levels.\\n324 \\n163. C. Alfred is using an information management system, which captures, stores, and\\ndistributes information to stakeholders of the project.\\n164. A. At the beginning of a project ambiguity is at its peak. Stakeholders have a great deal\\nof input into this. As the project progresses and work is underway, the cost of change\\nincreases and the volume of change begins to decrease. As this is the case, stakeholders\\nare most likely to get their requests for inclusion and changes approved during the initial\\nphase of the project.\\n165. C. The question is referring to pre-assignments, which can be negotiated within the\\ncontract, can be included in the project charter, or can be a result of a project that revolves\\naround a staff member’s expertise. Pre-assignments is used as a tool and technique of the\\nAcquire Team process.\\n166. A. This question involves applying the communication channels formula, which is:\\nn (n – 1) ÷ 2. Plugging 24 in place of the n results in 276.\\n167. C. The PMBOK® Guide defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,\\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives. A workaround is put into action\\nfor an unidentified negative risk that has occurred. An issue can be described as a negative\\nrisk or event that is occurring in the present. A trigger, or risk trigger, is an event that\\nsignifies a risk is about to materialize.\\n168. C. Notice that the constraint impacts the sequence of events of the project, since the\\nproject manager must work around the deadline of providing the necessary parts before\\nthe vendor can begin, based on a contractual requirement. Dependencies that result from a\\nphysical or contractual requirement are known as mandatory dependencies, or hard logic.\\n169. B. To answer this correctly, you’d need to recall Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs pyramid\\nand the five steps within the pyramid. The question asks for the highest level, which\\naccording to the pyramid is self-actualization.\\n170. C. A milestone has a duration of zero; it is a significant point or event in the project, such\\nas the completion of a deliverable.\\n171. D. Attending an expo does not translate to spying on the competition and is an\\nexample of networking. On a smaller scale, examples of networking include informal\\nconversations, committee gatherings, luncheons, and so on. In this scenario, Bob is being\\nproactive through his actions.\\n172. C. Of the options provided, the project management office (PMO) would be the best\\nchoice. The PMO is responsible for providing project managers with training and\\nresources. They also have archived organizational process assets, which would help in this\\nscenario, along with training. Offering to manage the project with him is implying that\\nyou will take on part of his project and responsibility, which is an incorrect answer. Not\\noffering any type of assistance is a poor choice, since part of our responsibility as project\\nmanagers is to encourage and educate other project managers, although not at the expense\\nof your own projects.\\n173. A. The correct choice is observation and conversation. This is a technique that allows the\\nproject manager to observe the attitudes of team members toward the project and better\\ngauge what is going on. The project manager also gets direct feedback from team members.\\n174. B. Negotiation and staff assignments don’t pertain to where a team member is located.\\nThat leaves virtual team and colocation. Virtual team includes project team members who\\nare located at different locations, often never even meeting face to face. This can include\\nworking from home offices, from a remote location in general, and at different company\\nsites. Colocation is when project team members are brought to work together at the same\\nphysical location. Based on these descriptions, virtual team is the correct choice.\\n175. D. The risk manager is utilizing the expert judgment technique. This involves subject-\\nmatter experts who are internal or external to the project and who validate the data and\\ntechniques used to conduct the process.\\n176. B. Reports are considered formal written, since they are an official report of the project,\\nand they are delivered in written format.\\n177. A. The correct choice is fringe benefits, which are those benefits provided to all employees.\\n178. B. The theorist responsible for the 14 Steps to Quality Management is W. Edwards Deming.\\n179. A-4, B-1, C-3, D-2. There are four project life cycle categories: predictive, iterative,\\nincremental, and Agile. The life cycle selected to manage a project is driven by various\\nfactors, one of which is life-cycle goal.\\n180. A. The minimum viable product (MVP) is used to increase the speed of delivery and\\nobtain feedback of a product early. The product contains just enough features or\\ndeliverables to obtain feedback; this feedback can then be used for future incremental\\ndevelopment of the product.\\n181. B. Referent power is based on the respect or admiration that others hold for an individual.\\n182. C. It’s often thought that the project manager or functional manager is responsible for\\nresolving this type of conflict. But in actuality, these individuals should be brought in only\\nto provide assistance or to address the conflict in a formal manner. The best option is that\\nthe project team members resolve the conflict on their own, directly.\\n183. C. Conflict management is not a form of feedback; 360-degree feedback is a formal type\\nof feedback, as opposed to observation and conversation. 360-degree feedback is a type of\\nappraisal, whereas team performance assessment focuses on the team’s performance.\\n184. A. Money already spent refers to sunk costs. Opportunity cost refers to money lost when\\nselecting one project over another, equaling the value of the project that was passed up.\\nDirect costs are costs that are directly attributed to the work on the project. Fixed costs\\nare costs that remain the same throughout the project, such as rentals.\\n185. A. Negotiations and project staff assignments take place within the Acquire Project Team\\nprocess, the second process within the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area.\\n326 \\n186. C. Gold plating is when additional functionality is added that is outside of the project\\nscope. Sometimes this is done with good intentions, but it is not considered acceptable,\\nno matter what the intent is. If the addition was not a part of the project requirements,\\nquality is not considered to have been met.\\n187. B. Joseph Juran is connected to the concept that the results produced should be fit for use\\nby the customer.\\n188. A. Exploit is a strategy used when the organization is interested in making sure that\\nthe risk occurs, as well as increasing the impact of the positive risks. Exploit is the exact\\nopposite of avoid, which seeks to eliminate the possibility of the risk occurring. The\\nprimary difference between exploit and enhance is that exploit applies changes to ensure\\nthat the opportunity will occur, which may or may not include an increase in the\\nimpact, while enhance only increases the likelihood and/or impact of the opportunity\\noccurring.\\n189. D. Quality metrics determine what to measure and what the acceptable measurements are.\\n190. B. There are three types of organizational structures: functional, matrix, and project-\\noriented.\\n191. D. Empathy, influence, and creativity are forms of interpersonal skills, also referred to\\nas soft skills. Interpersonal skills itself is part of general management skills. It is thought\\nthat the project manager can decrease issues and increase cooperation by understanding\\nhow project team members are feeling, knowing what their concerns are, and being able to\\nfollow up on existing issues.\\n192. B. Defining what acceptable behavior looks like may have taken care of this issue from\\nthe start. Even though John felt that Nick’s issue was not an immediate priority, all issues\\nshould be allowed to be brought to the table or through the outlined procedures.\\n193. C. The correct answer is poor quality. Remember that quality also looks to remove waste\\nand non-value-added processes. It looks to improve processes and make sure that project\\nrequirements are being met.\\n194. C. The project charter is created to formalize a project. Following the start of the project,\\nidentification and analysis of stakeholders come next.\\n195. C. Benchmarking takes the current project and compares it to other projects, using the\\nprevious projects as the point of comparison.\\n196. B. As the sender of the information, the project team member is responsible for\\nconfirming that the project manager understood the information and that the information\\nis complete and clear. On the other end, the project manager also failed to meet the\\nresponsibilities of a receiver, which are to make sure that they understood the information\\ncorrectly and that it was received in its entirety.\\n197. D. The resource management plan is a component of the project management plan. It\\noutlines the training needs, safety needs, and compliance of the project. As an extra note,\\nit also contains details of how the project team will be acquired, managed, and released.\\n198. B. 360-degree feedback is a type of project performance appraisal, where feedback is\\nreceived from all levels of interaction with a team member. This provides information\\nabout a team member but not from a team member. Next, observation and conversation\\ncome together as a technique from the Manage Project Team process. It’s a way for the\\nproject manager to monitor the team’s progress, accomplishments, and interpersonal\\nissues and is therefore the correct answer. Issue log simply tracks issues so is not relevant\\nhere, and team-building activities seems like a good choice, except that the purpose is to\\ngrow relationships among the team so the focus is on establishing this cohesiveness and of\\nworking together, not of assessing work attitudes.\\n199. D. A face-to-face meeting is the preferred method for dealing with stakeholders. There\\nis nothing within the question to indicate that a one-on-one meeting with stakeholders is\\nrequired, which makes “an in-person meeting” the best and most efficient choice.\\n200. D. PERT stands for program evaluation and review technique and uses a weighted average\\nof the following three estimates: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely. PERT analysis is\\nused as part of the three-point estimating tool and technique within the Estimate Activity\\nDurations and Estimate Costs processes.'"
