A\\nA is the correct answer because the recommendations\\nfor corrective and preventive actions and change\\nrequests must be processed through the Perform\\nIntegrated Change Control process for approval.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect because changes and\\nrecommendations are approved through the Perform\\nIntegrated Change Control process.\\n13. B\\nB is the correct answer because approved change\\nrequests are implemented through the Direct and\\nManage Project Work process.\\nA is incorrect because project management is\\nperformed through processes.\\nC is incorrect because the Perform Integrated Change\\nControl process is used to process the change\\nrequests, and not to implement them.\\nD is incorrect because the Monitor and Control\\nProject Work process generates the change requests\\nand does not implement them.\\n14. B\\nB is the correct answer because performance reports\\nare input into the Perform Integrated Change Control\\nprocess.\\nA and C are incorrect because the Monitor and\\nControl Project Work process generates performance\\nreports and does not need them, and performance\\nreports are not input into the Close Project process.\\nD is incorrect because there is no standard process\\nwith this name.\\n15. D\\nD is the correct answer because no project, small or\\nlarge or even a cancelled one, should skip the closing\\nstage.\\nA, B, and C are incorrect because no project should\\nskip the closing stage. Each project must go through a\\nproper closure.\\n16. C\\nC is the correct answer because it is the project\\nsponsor who signs the final closure documents and\\ncan send the project to closure at any stage of the\\nproject.\\nA is incorrect because the project manager is\\nresponsible for managing all the activities needed to\\nclose the project, but the closure must be authorized\\nby the sponsor.\\nB and D are incorrect because neither the customer\\nnor the functional manager can authorize the project\\nclosure according to the standard.\\n17.

It may very well increase cost when you commit\\nadditional resources.\\n3. A\\nA is the correct answer because there is no room for\\nfloat times on the critical path.\\nB and C are incorrect because the critical path\\ncontrols the finish date only for a given start date and\\nvice versa.\\nD is incorrect because the critical path is the longest\\nsequence in time, not the shortest.\\n4. B\\nB is the correct answer because an activity has an\\nexternal dependency when it relies on factors outside\\nthe project.\\nA is incorrect because Activity Y has a mandatory\\ndependency on Activity X when Y legally or inherently\\ndepends on X. It’s possible to track down the tourist\\neven after the season.\\nC is incorrect because there is no such dependency\\ncalled internal.\\nD is incorrect because we don’t have an internal\\ndependency here.\\n5. B\\nB is the correct answer because finish-to-start\\ndependency means that the successor (B) activity\\ncannot start until the predecessor (A) activity is\\nfinished.\\nA is incorrect because the start-to-finish relationship\\nmeans that the successor activity cannot finish until\\nthe predecessor activity is started.\\nC is incorrect because we do not have enough\\ninformation to say that this dependency is mandatory.\\nD is incorrect because although there is a dependency\\nbetween two activities, that does not mean they are\\non the critical path.\\n6. A\\nA is the correct answer because each activity on the\\ncritical path has a zero float time, and therefore if an\\nactivity is delayed, it will delay the entire project.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect because these are incorrect\\nstatements about the activities on the critical path.\\n7. C\\nC is the correct answer because the analogous\\nestimating technique estimates the duration of an\\nactivity based on the duration of a similar activity in a\\nprevious project.\\nA is incorrect because parametric estimating uses\\nparameters such as the productivity rate of the\\nresource assigned to the activity.\\nB is incorrect because the individual in this example\\nused the analogous method and not expert judgment,\\neven though he happened to be an expert—we don’t\\nknow in which field.\\nD is incorrect because the Delphi technique is not for\\nthe activity duration estimating technique.\\n8. C\\nC is correct because the team member is offering a\\nvalid reason for the change, and it does not affect the\\nfinish date of the project. However, you must change\\nthe schedule to reflect the new duration estimate.\\nB is incorrect because you must change the schedule\\nto reflect the new duration estimate that you accepted.\\nA is incorrect because you do not need to consult\\nwith the functional manager in making this decision\\nbecause the team member is offering a valid reason\\nfor the change and it does not affect the finish date of\\nthe project.\\nD is incorrect because this change does not qualify to\\nbe processed through the Integrated Change Control\\nprocess.\\n9. A\\nA is the correct answer because float time is the\\npositive difference between the allowed late start date\\nand the early start date of a schedule activity, without\\nchanging the schedule finish date.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect because these are not valid\\nterms used to describe delaying an activity without\\nchanging the schedule finish date.\\n10. B\\nB is the correct answer because by doing some\\nactivities in parallel (fast tracking) you might be able\\nto compress the schedule without adding cost.\\nA is incorrect because crashing usually results in\\nincreased cost because it involves adding extra\\nresources.\\nC is incorrect because the project sponsor is\\nsponsoring (paying for) the project. So, asking for a\\nnew sponsor does not make sense; it can only trigger\\nthe sponsor to ask for a new project manager.\\nD is incorrect because you do not want to bypass the\\nsponsor on budgetary matters, because the budget\\nwill need the sponsor’s approval.\\n11. C\\nC is the correct answer because it has the longest\\nsequence: 8 + 6 + 8 = 22 \\nA is incorrect because this path is only 20 units long.\\nB is incorrect because there is no such path as Start-\\nI-G-E-Finish in this network diagram.\\nD is incorrect because this path is only 21 units long,\\nwhich is less than 22 \\n12. D\\nD is the correct answer because the float time for G\\nis zero since it is on the critical path.\\nA, B, and C are incorrect because G is on the critical\\npath and must have a float time of zero.\\n13. C\\nC is the correct answer because if you consider all\\nthe paths in the network diagram, the path Start-I-G-\\nH-Finish adds up to 22, which is longer than any other\\npath in the diagram.\\nA, B, and D are incorrect because the length of a path\\nis not measured by the number of nodes in it.\\n14. B\\nB is the correct answer because in the three-point\\nmethod, in this case, using the weighted average is:\\n(9 + 18 + 4 × 12)1/6 = 12,5 \\nA is incorrect because a weight of 4 is assigned to the\\nmost-likely scenario as compared to the weight of 1\\nfor each of the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.\\nC and D are incorrect because the duration estimate\\nshould be the weighted average of the three points.\\n15. B\\nB is the correct answer because the activity duration\\nis calculated after an activity has been defined.\\nA, C, and D are incorrect because the WBS, project\\nscope statement, and WBS dictionary (as parts of the\\nscope baseline) are valid input items to the Define\\nActivities process.\\n16. D\\nD is the correct answer because work performance\\ndata is an input to this process, and not an output.\\nA, B, and C are incorrect because all these items\\ncould be parts of the output of the Schedule Control\\nprocess.\\n17.

B\\nB is the correct answer because you need resources\\nfigured out before you can estimate costs.\\nA and C are incorrect because you cannot estimate\\ncosts until you have a resource plan to figure out\\nresources, and you cannot determine budget until you\\nhave cost estimates.\\nD is incorrect because you need resources figured\\nout before you can plan for costs management.\\n2. A\\nA is the correct answer, and the other answers are\\nincorrect, because the activity source needs to be\\nknown before you can estimate the activity duration\\nto schedule; and resources and schedule need to be\\nknown for estimating costs and determining budget.\\n3. A\\nA is the correct answer because the contingency\\nreserve is applied both to activity durations (time) and\\ncost estimates.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are\\ntrue statements about the contingency reserve.\\n4. A\\nA is the correct answer because the cost baseline is\\nan output of the Determine Budget process.\\nB is incorrect because there is no standard process\\nwith this name.\\nC is incorrect because the Estimate Costs process is\\nused to estimate the costs, and these estimates need\\nto be aggregated to determine the budget.\\nD is incorrect because cost baseline is an input to the\\nControl Cost process.\\n5. B\\nB is the correct answer because the formula for\\nearned value is: EV = BAC X (work completed/total\\nwork required), which means\\nEV = $600,000 X (5 miles / 15 miles) = $200,000\\nA is incorrect because $160,000 is the actual cost\\n(AC) and not the earned value (EV).\\nC is incorrect because earned value is proportional to\\nthe fraction of work performed and not the fraction\\nof time passed.\\nD is incorrect because $600,000 is the budget at\\ncompletion (BAC), not the EV.\\n6. C\\nC is the correct answer because the formula for\\nplanned value is: PV = BAC X (time passed / total\\nschedule time), which means PV = $600,000 X (3\\nweeks / 12 weeks) = $150,000\\nA is incorrect because $160,000 is the actual cost\\n(AC) and not the planned value (EV).\\nB is incorrect because planned value is proportional\\nto the fraction of time passed, not the fraction of\\nwork performed.\\nD is incorrect because $600,000 is the budget at\\ncompletion (BAC), not the PV.\\n7.

B\\nB is the correct answer because a risk can have a\\nnegative or a positive effect on a project.\\nA, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are\\ntrue statements about project risks.\\n2. A\\nA is correct because the risk register is the output of\\nthe risk identification process, but it is not used as an\\ninput because it does not exist before this process.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect because the risk register\\nis an input item to perform qualitative risk analysis,\\nperform quantitative risk analysis, plan risk responses,\\nimplement risk responses, and monitor risks.\\n3. B\\nB is the correct answer because there is no standard\\ntechnique called Delphi used in the Identify Risks\\nprocess according to the PMBOK Edition 6.\\nA, C, and D are incorrect answers because\\nbrainstorming is the data-gathering technique, and\\nSWOT analysis and root-cause analysis are the data-\\nanalysis techniques, used for identifying risks.\\n4. A\\nA is the correct answer because, depending upon the\\nexperience of the team, risks can be moved directly\\nafter the identification process to the quantitative\\nanalysis process without performing qualitative\\nanalysis.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect answers because these are\\ntrue statements.\\n5. B\\nB is correct because building redundancy into a\\nsystem is an example of mitigating the risk.\\nA is incorrect because the risk can still happen because\\nyou have not changed the plan, such as moving the\\nserver center to some other city.\\nC is incorrect because accepting a risk means no\\nproactive action taken; this is not the case here.\\nD is incorrect because you have not transferred the\\nrisk to a third party.\\n6. D\\nD is correct because the risk has been transferred to\\na third party.\\nA is incorrect because the risk can still happen because\\nyou have not changed the plan, such as eliminating the\\nneed for that part of the system.\\nB is incorrect because mitigating the risk does not\\ninvolve transferring the risk to a third party.\\nC is incorrect because accepting a risk means taking\\nno proactive action.\\n7. C\\nC is correct because the numerical analysis of a risk is\\ncalled quantitative risk analysis.\\nA is incorrect because assigning numbers does not\\nnecessarily mean you are performing a Monte Carlo\\nsimulation, although it is one of the tools used to\\nperform quantitative analysis.\\nB is incorrect because qualitative analysis does not\\ninvolve numerical analysis, such as EMV calculations.\\nD is incorrect because risk response planning will be\\nbased on the results of risk analysis.\\n8. D\\nD is correct because the probability of the risk is 50\\npercent, and the probability of the positive impact is\\n40 percent, so the total probability for the positive\\nimpact to happen is 0.5 X 0.4 = 0.2.\\nEMV = Probability X Value of the outcome = 0.2 X\\n$200,000 = $40,000\\nA, B, and C are incorrect because they show wrong\\nvalues for EMV.\\n9.

D\\nD is correct because secondary risks are those risks\\nthat arise as a result of risk responses.\\nA is incorrect because a residual risk is a risk that\\nremains after a response has been performed.\\nB is incorrect because, depending upon the nature of\\nthe secondary risk, it may have any priority.\\nC is incorrect because the risk response will depend\\nupon the analysis results of the risk.\\n11. D\\nD is the correct answer because there is no such\\nstandard risk response named risk rejection.\\nA, B, and C are all incorrect answers because these\\nare valid risk responses.\\n12. A\\nA is correct because SWOT is a risk-identification\\ntechnique that identifies risks by examining the\\nstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats\\n(SWOT) of a given project.\\nB is incorrect because this is a wrong statement about\\nSWOT.\\nC and D are incorrect because SWOT is a technique\\nused in risk identification, not in risk response planning\\nor in quantitative risk analysis.\\n13. C\\nC is the correct answer because you need to perform\\nquantitative risk analysis to create a list of risks\\nprioritized based on the total effect of each risk on\\nthe overall project objectives.\\nA, B, and D are incorrect because these are the\\npossible output items from qualitative risk analysis.\\n14. D\\nD is the correct answer because the decision about a\\nrisk-related contractual agreement can be an output\\nof risk response planning, not the quantitative risk\\nanalysis.\\nA, B, and C are incorrect because all these are the\\npossible output items from the quantitative risk\\nanalysis.\\n15. D\\nD is the correct answer because risk-related\\nrecommendations for corrective actions are the\\noutput of the risk monitoring and controlling process.\\nA, B, and C are incorrect because the outputs of these\\nprocesses do not include recommended corrective\\nactions.\\n16. A\\nA is the correct answer because the recommendations\\nfor corrective and preventive actions and change\\nrequests must be processed through the Integrated\\nChange Control process for approval.\\nB, C, and D are incorrect because changes and\\nrecommendations are approved through the\\nIntegrated Change Control process.\\n17.
